Moving into a new home at the end of December, so we need someone to take over the rest of our lease which ends February 28th, 2019.
2 Bed / 2 Bath top floor unit with a beautiful open view, overlooking residential neighborhood towards the East Bay mountains. We've lived in the unit for almost 3 years but is still in great condition. No shoes No pets. 
Great location right off 101 and 92. Less than 5 minutes to Whole Foods and walking distance to the new bay meadows retail area where there's a Blue Bottle, Tin Pot Creamery, Roam Burger and Field Works Brewery.  Downtown San Mateo is 10 mins away by car.
The community is great, there's a BBQ Area, Resident Cafe and Fitness Centre that's open 24/7. Free Yoga classes every Saturday and Mediation sessions every month.
This is great for short term stays or a great chance to check out the area before committing to a longer-term lease.
Feel free to contact me if any questions or to arrange for a tour.
