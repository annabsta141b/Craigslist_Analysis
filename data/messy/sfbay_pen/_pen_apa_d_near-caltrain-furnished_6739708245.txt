I have a super friendly beautiful dog! She does not  bark, sleep at her crate in the living room , very well trained and has high energy. My dog won't interfere with your enjoyment of your rooms !I don't allow her to go to guest bedroom side or my bedroom . She only allowed in the living room . During the day , she only play a little bit in the living room under my supervision or stays in her crate .  I take her outdoor to do excises daily  . She is very mild as long as she gets enough excises. This breed is pretty clean and has less dog odors . They clean themselves like cats do . I also take her out to groomers so she maintains very good hygiene.  I would like someone who likes dog and have knowledge about dogs , someone who feel comfortable around dogs to share this space !  You are welcome to play with her only if you like !  If you own a dog before  , I would consider you first !
