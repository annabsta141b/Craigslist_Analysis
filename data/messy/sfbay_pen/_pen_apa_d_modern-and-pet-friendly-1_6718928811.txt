 DESCRIPTION  Come to 100 Moffett today to find the perfect one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment. Included in this spacious layout are a bathroom with Carrara tile and a bedroom with a walk-in closet and Elfa closet organizer. When you are not relaxing in your spacious home, take in a breath of fresh air on your private patio. Throughout the home, you have wood plank flooring and oversized windows. The kitchen offers a subway tile backsplash, quartz countertops, and stainless steel appliances. 100 Moffett has developed a neighborhood that encourages interaction. Spend some time with neighbors on the rooftop patio and cook some barbecue on one of the available grills, or you can simply stay warm beside the fire pit. Play Marco Polo in the private swimming pool or chat with friends in the clubhouse with available Wi-Fi. Take the short trip--fifty-seven steps--to Caltrain for access to all of downtown.
