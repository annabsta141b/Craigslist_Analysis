Has a lot of closet space.  Big windows...lots of light.  Around 800 sq ft (+ or -).  Near El Camino bus line.  Easy walk to downtown Burlingame.  Quiet building.  Pergo type floors.  New appliances.  No smoking.  No dogs.  No housing programs.  Thinking sometime around mid-January.  (Am not showing the unit or getting pictures until the tenant gives me their moving date.)  Please give me some information about yourselves, needs, moving dates that might work around that time frame (or after).  Please leave me a # to call you.
