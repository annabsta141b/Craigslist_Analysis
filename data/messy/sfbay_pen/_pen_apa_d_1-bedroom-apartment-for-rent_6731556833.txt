Location: 88th St and Edgeworth
This 1 bedroom unit is located on the 2nd floor. It comes with plenty of closet space, a heater, a balcony, with granite countertops in the kitchen. The bathroom has a tub and a separate shower.
There is laundry in the building and an elevator for your convenience.
Very easy to get to San Francisco and the Peninsula via 280, or Skyline. Easy access to BART and bus lines. Minutes from lots of shopping (Westlake, Serramonte, Stonestown, etc.), restaurants, Seton Medical Center, schools, and the post office is right on the corner. 
We pay for water and garbage. You are responsible for gas/electric, cable, and internet, etc. 
*Because we have fewer parking spaces than apartments, we assign spaces based on move-in date. There are a couple of tenants that would need to move out, before you would be assigned a space.*
Move in cost: $2350.00 plus $2350.00 security deposit. If moving on any day other than the 1st of the month, you will also need to pay the prorated rent for that first month.
Contract is month to month, by default, but can be modified based on your needs. We do not accept section 8.
If you are interested, please be ready to provide the following information: 
1. Target move in date 
2. Name(s) of lease holder and number of occupants
3. Proof of income, a current credit report, and verifiable references
