There is no other community offering the features, amenities, walkable location, and outdoor beauty that Palo Alto Plaza offers.  You must see the large interior courtyard with mature trees and flowers that surround the resort pool, spa, and fitness center.  It is difficult to find such a peaceful oasis in an area where you are still able to walk to shops, cafes, and the Caltrain station.  You also have peace of mind with a controlled access lobby and gated parking.  Combined with phenomenal new kitchens, wood floors, and double pane windows, Palo Alto Plaza offers you the latest in contemporary urban living (like the co-work space with free Wi-Fi and a package concierge system with 24/7 pickup) within the peacefulness of a park-like setting. This apartment requires a $400 deposit.
