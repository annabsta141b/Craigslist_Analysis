DESCRIPTION
________________________________________
 The Verandas Apartments in Menlo Park! 
We can't wait to introduce you to all the great benefits we have to offer. Enjoy a lazy afternoon sitting on the sundeck beside our sparkling swimming pool. Appreciate the beautiful Mediterranean inspired landscaping and carefully selected exterior color palette. Rather spend the day inside? Your apartment has a complete package of amenities to make you feel right at home. Whip something up in your fully equipped kitchen-complete with updated dishwasher, refrigerator, and garbage disposal.
Of course, it's still about Location, Location, Location. And where else would you rather live than Menlo Park? Easy access to highway 101--North to San Francisco or South to San Jose. It's also a quick drive to the East Bay--the Dumbarton Bridge is just a few miles away. Prefer to take the train? Choose from TWO Caltrain stations just minutes from your front door.
