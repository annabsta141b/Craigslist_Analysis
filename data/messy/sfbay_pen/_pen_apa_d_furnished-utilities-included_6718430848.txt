The master bedroom has privacy, is extremely spacious, furnished with a Tempurpedic king sized bed , accompanying furniture and private bathroom. The bathroom is updated, faces the backyard so its very quiet.
You would share the common areas with three other respectful housemates who each have their own bedroom. We are quiet and respectful. We travel a lot but enjoy being home and getting the best out of our West Menlo Park community.  This place is perfect for someone who just wants a peaceful place to rest or study. The rest of the home and kitchen are already completely furnished. 
Absolutely not ok with drug use, no smoking, and only normal alcohol use in the home, meaning we enjoy a glass of wine and beer here and there but not ok with big parties and heavy drinking in the home. We're very laid back, but just want to make surround ourselves with people who are as respectful as we are. No overnight guests allowed unless its friends, family, significant others visiting with notice. We don't want strangers in our home. We practice quiet hours after 10pm :) 
If interested, or if you think you would be a good fit, text or email us a bit about yourself. You're welcome to come check out the place and see it.
