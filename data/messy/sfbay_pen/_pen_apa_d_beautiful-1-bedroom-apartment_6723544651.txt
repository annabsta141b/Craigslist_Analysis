Located in a safe, quiet neighborhood, this apartment is part of a small (7 unit) complex and is a short walk to downtown San Carlos.  The police department is only one block away.  Easy access to Highway 101 and Interstate 280.  Many conveniences, such as drug and grocery stores, coffee shops, home improvement and fine dining are a short walk to downtown.
San Carlos is a wonderful community in which to reside and offers an outstanding farmer's market through the summer months, street faire in the fall and an array of community services and activities throughout the year.  
Unit amenities include:
-  Gas/electric appliances (new stove/oven, refrigerator)
-  New carpet
-  New granite countertops and tile in kitchen
-  Fully renovated bathroom
-  Carport (one car)
-  Outside storage 
-  On-site laundry
This apartment is currently undergoing renovations and is expected to be available by November 1st.  Although the apartment is still under renovations, I'll hold an open house on Saturday, October 20th, between 12:00 pm and 2:00 pm.  Please email for more information.
$1900/month rent + $1500 security deposit.  A credit report is required.
