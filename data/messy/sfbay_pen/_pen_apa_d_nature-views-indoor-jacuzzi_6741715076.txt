Cozy, sparkling apartment is NOT a part of an apartment complex. But stands on its OWN, with rich OUTDOORS life, on top of the hill. Quiet and intimate.
This is as if leaving in a house: no other apartments around, you have your own huge backyard, large verandas, Gazebo, large double deck, overlooking the entire Bay Area; swings, hammocks in the shade of the trees under the waterfalls. A beautiful lush green garden surrounds the building. Fresh air as you enter the apartment, with almost no cars around, therapeutically quiet cul-de-sac.
Overlooking the rolling green hills of the Canyon, drinking its air, you have your very OWN:
- Separate private entrance from the quiet courtyard
