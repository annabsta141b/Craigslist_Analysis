2Bd/2 full Baths - Beautiful setting and a GREAT LOCATION off Hwy 101 and 280: close to the new BART and Millbrae TRAIN STATION, making the city of San Francisco, and the valley all easily accessible. This is a great building with lovely grounds: a central courtyard with POOL. Moments away to the San Francisco Int'l Airport, yet walking distance to the charming downtown Millbrae shops and restaurants (Trader Joes-Safeway-Starbucks), the library, and parks.
LARGE with a "home-like" feel, in a very quiet and sunny setting. FORMAL DINING ROOM + Dinette. Modern kitchen has a trash compactor and dishwasher. The living room has a working FIREPLACE and a DECK overlooking the pool. Crown molding, carpets, blinds, freshly painted & squeaky clean!
Large master bedroom with bathroom ensuite and a large walk-in closet. Second large bedroom with a walk-in closet, and a large closet in the hallway. Central vacuum system throughout. 
VERY WELL MAINTAINED building with a manager on site. Large enclosed garage. Elevator from the garage and lobby to your unit. A GREAT VALUE for all these amenities. To view call the manager, Alex at  show contact info
