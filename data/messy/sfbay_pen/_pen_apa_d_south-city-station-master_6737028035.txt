Popular South City Station Apartment, master bedroom of the 2B2B apartment with furniture. Looking for someone to take over my lease as I moved recently due to personal change.
Address: 101 McLellan Drive, South San Francisco, CA 94080
Current lease will expire on 2019 June 20, rent + parking for you is $1787, and all other fees are split into 3 shares and you only take one share because roommate is a couple.
The apartment has well-equipped facilities for gym/clubhouse/pool, and it's super convenient around, Costco, Trader Joe's, Starbucks, Chase, and BART right across the street. I lived here for 2+ years, it only takes 20 min on BART to the civic center station, door-to-door commute time to the office around the civic center is 30 min, drive to San Mateo is around 20 min.
The floor plan is 2 Bedroom 2 Bathroom, spacious 1054 sq ft, with living room separating both bedrooms, and the window is facing apartment internal garden so super quiet. Pretty spacious bedroom, with walk-in closet, big bathroom and bathtub, two big windows, and in-house dry & clean, with parking.

The roommate is a couple, they are very nice and quiet, both professionals working in Box and Microsoft.
