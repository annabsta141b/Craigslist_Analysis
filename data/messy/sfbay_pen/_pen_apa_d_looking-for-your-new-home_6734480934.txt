If you are looking for your next home, just give us a call.  
We have several locations in Belmont and are sure to have the apartment you are looking for with the amenities that you want.  
Our apartments have large open floor plans with big rooms and lots of closet space and are located in smaller buildings where you get personalized service and are known on a first name basis.  Our premises are well maintained, clean and QUIET.  If you are looking for a place to party, these are NOT the places for you.  All buildings feature swimming pools and laundry facilities.   
Rents start at $2100 for a one-bedroom and this includes water, sewer, parking (with extra storage space!) and trash collection - no added fees at the end of the month.  A credit check with good credit, security deposit and renter's insurance are required.  No pets, smoking or barbecues are allowed.  Sorry, but we do not accept housing assistance (Section 8, HIP, Bridge, etc.).
To set up an appointment to view the apartments, just give us a call today using the information in the attached link.  We look forward to hearing from you.  
Thanks for viewing our posting and we hope you have a great day.
