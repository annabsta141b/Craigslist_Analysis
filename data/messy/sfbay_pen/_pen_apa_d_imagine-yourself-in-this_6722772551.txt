	Our one bedroom Brewster floor plan offers 680 square feet with an open concept living room, dining area, and kitchen. The newly renovated kitchen features energy saving appliances such as an electric stove, large refrigerator, dishwasher, and built in microwave.  Wood style plank flooring runs throughout the home with carpeting in the bedroom to offer a stylish finish. Large expansive windows in both living room and bedroom provide natural light throughout the apartment from dawn till dusk. Call today for a tour and see one of our gorgeous apartment homes!

	It's never been easier to travel throughout the bay area! Our incredible community is located conveniently next to the 101 on the peninsula between San Francisco and San Jose. Our residents are close to schools, shopping, nature and to the many downtown centers close by. Although it may be easy to want to spend the day at home when living at Avenue Two (with our 24 hour gym, laid back pool area, picnic garden and expansive resident lounge all at your fingertips) you will be in the perfect area to explore the Bay Area. Apply today to lock down the best apartment in the best area before they are all gone!
