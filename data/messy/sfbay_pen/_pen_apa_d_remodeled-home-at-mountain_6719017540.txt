Small portable air conditioning cools the house in the summer.
We are in the planning process for adding a second accessory structure.. The current house will be fenced off and not directly affected by construction. We would likely not start in earnest until the spring including saturdays.
Probably the dust in the garage where the washer dryer is would be the biggest negative.
