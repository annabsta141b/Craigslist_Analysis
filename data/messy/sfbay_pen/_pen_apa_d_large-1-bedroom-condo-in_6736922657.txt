We have an bright, spacious, large (748sq ft) 1 bedroom condo available for lease starting in December. An outdoor enthusiast's dream home. The condo has 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom. It has newer hardwood floors, tile flooring in the kitchen/dining room/bathroom.  The condo offers good storage space in the garage, a massive concrete patio and garden that is fenced off for security, and two car enclosed parking spots.  The entire exterior of the Admiralty complex has been extensively renovated/updated with new windows, front doors, sliding glass patio doors, new decks, new fences, new outdoor lighting, etc.  The entire complex looks as if it is a newer development.
The condo is in a very accessible area that is close to all the amenities of Foster City.  It falls within the best school district (Brewer Island Elementary and Bowdith Middle School).  It is 1 block from the Jewish Community Center (state of the art Gym and Spa facility), 2.2 miles away from Whole Foods, 3 blocks away from the Foster City Dog Park, down the street from Ranch 99 Market, Starbucks, UPS, Safeway, OSH Supply and Hardware, Costco, etc. It is also located within a great school system with Brewer Island Elementary within walking distance. You must see to believe it. Tranquility abounds as you wake up to your own private patio and walkway daily.
