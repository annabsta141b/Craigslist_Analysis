We currently have for immediate move-in this huge top floor two-bedroom two-bath apartment.  It was recently remodeled and has two large bedrooms with lots of closet space, two full bathrooms, a kitchen with a dishwasher, full dining area, very spacious living room, two additional closets including an oversized (almost room-size) walk-in closet and a full-length balcony.  New carpeting has also been installed.
The apartment is very bright and quiet and is detached on all four sides with no one above you.  It comes with a covered carport and additional storage.  We have a resident manager, swimming pool and laundry room.  Water, sewer and trash collection are included in the rent.   There are no additional fees.
It is located in Carlmont Village, which is a very serene area within walking distance of Waterdog Nature Preserve, Carlmont Shopping Center, the Public Library and much more.  Highways 101, 280 and 92 are just a short drive away.
The rent is $2995, the lease term is one year and a credit check with good credit is required.  We do not accept housing vouchers.
