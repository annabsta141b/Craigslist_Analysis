We are currently working on completing a large one-bedroom apartment in a quiet building in a secluded neighborhood in the Belmont Hills.
Just some of its features are:
* A huge open kitchen with about 27 cabinets and drawers, tons of counter space, refrigerator, stove and dishwasher
* A large bright living room that leads to a full-length balcony with a view of the Bay
* A spacious bedroom with a large closet
* Very generous closet space with a hall closet, linen closet and the large bedroom closet
* Also included is a covered carport with a very big storage cabinet - a perfect spot to store camping gear, luggage and other items.
* A laundry room and swimming pool.
The rent is $2100 per month which includes parking, water, sewer and trash collection - no additional fees!
The lease term is 12 months; a credit check, renter's insurance and security deposit are required.  Sorry, but we do not accept housing vouchers or pets.  Smoking and barbecues are not allowed.
Although the apartment is in progress we would be happy to show it to you, just use your imagination.  To set up an appointment to see this apartment, please call us at the phone number listed in the contact information in this posting.
We look forward to hearing from you.
