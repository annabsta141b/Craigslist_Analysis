If you want to lease the apartment for a longer-term, we recommend you try to lease it directly with the apartment community, but you have to go through us first so we can let them know. We will pay you two weeks of your rent if you take over the whole lease with the apartment community directly. 
Please contact Anthony for any further information. Please note that we reserve the right to change terms based on our availability. 
*Please note this offering is being made by a private company and not the apartment community directly.  Our office hours are 8am-5pm, PST, from M-F, excepting holidays.  Calls received after business hours will be answered by our after hours service staff who can assist in the event of an emergency need.  The photos are representational only and do not often depict the actual apartment or furnishings.  This offering is subject to availability and may change at any time.  Leasing from the property directly may include different credit and deposit criteria than leasing through Regency directly.
