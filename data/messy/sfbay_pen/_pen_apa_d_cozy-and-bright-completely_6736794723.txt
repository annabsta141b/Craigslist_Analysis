Cozy and bright, completely refurbished Airstream uniquely designed for the minimalist, nestled by the sea in lushly landscaped backyard, with a large wrap around deck and breathtaking ocean views. Airstream comes complete with access to high speed internet, a 4 burner gas cooktop, sink and under counter fridge, breakfast nook, queen size bed, Venetian plaster walls and ceilings with locally sourced old growth Redwood trim throughout, all accented with large windows and complimentary lighting. Also includes spacious bathroom and shower with on demand hot water and onsite washer/dryer. The Airstream is nestled beneath a Eucalyptus grove, surrounded by a beautiful yard & garden, only a moments' walk to the beach. Make your coffee while gazing at ocean views. Literally, walk out of the back yard to hiking and mountain biking trails.
Short scenic walk to local restaurants, bars, grocery stores and public transportation; 15 mins to SFO & downtown San Francisco, immediate access to historic HWY 1, and short commute times to central Bay Area hubs make this an ideal rental. You have it all, yet it feels like you are in your own little paradise. Pets must be approved and come with a reference. Furnished or Unfurnished. 6 month to 1 year Lease.  Utilities not included.
