Rare waterfront penthouse apartment available for lease.  Approximately 2,400 square feet comprised of 2-3 bedrooms, 1.5 baths. Great escape from the fast paced city life.

This 3rd floor apartment has it all: four fireplaces, two car garage with an electric car charger, private elevator from the garage to the penthouse, large open kitchen, laundry room, solarium, etc.  Wide open floor plan provides incredible views from every room.
The apartment is walking distance to amazing restaurants, fresh fish off of the docks at Pillar Point Harbor, retail shops, the Coastal Trail and many other outdoor activities including sailing, surfing, fishing, kayaking, beach walking, hiking and biking. The property is a short commute to the San Mateo Peninsula, San Francisco and San Jose.
