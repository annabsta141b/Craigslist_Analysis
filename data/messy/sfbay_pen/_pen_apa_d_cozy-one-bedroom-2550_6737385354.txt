 Property Description 
This one-bedroom apartment home at Hillsdale Square offers a modern living space in the ideal location for commuters. Our community is two blocks from the Hillsdale Caltrain station, which gives residents easy access to the entire peninsula with just a short walk. Our location also accommodates those who prefer to drive to work as we're only moments from freeways that can take you across the San Mateo Bridge to the East Bay or to major employers in San Francisco and San Jose. At the end of a work day, residents enjoy coming home to a private community that has controlled access and covered parking, as well as bike storage. Once at home, residents can easily stay connected for work in apartments wired for high-speed Internet. When it comes time to relax, our residents enjoy sweating out toxins in the sauna, working out in our fitness center, or unwinding in our Zen-style courtyards.
