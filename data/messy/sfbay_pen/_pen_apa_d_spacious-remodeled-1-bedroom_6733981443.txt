This one bedroom unit is larger than most typical one bedroom offerings found along the Peninsula with approximately 750 sqft of living space and balcony.  The Unit is located on the second floor of a three floor building with brand new finishes featuring a brand new kitchen with new appliances, dishwasher, disposal, lots of counter space, new granite counter tops, all new cabinetry, and flooring!  Good size bathroom that has been remodeled, digital thermostat, and lots of living space with an abundance of natural light.  The unit has a unique feature of having a built-in desk to the living area which serves as a den allowing designated space to work form home or just as a place to plug in.  The unit also features a large balcony that opens up to the living space - must see to appreciate!
