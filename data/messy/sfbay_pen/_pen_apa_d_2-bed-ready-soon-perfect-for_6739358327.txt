	This 2 bedroom unit is truly spacious, bright and airy. The plentiful storage throughout the apartment, private balcony, and super sized living room offer you exactly what you are looking for in a 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment. On top of the great layout comes an updated kitchen space that includes new countertops, appliances, and cabinetry. There is nothing quite like the Roosevelt in Redwood City!

	It's never been easier to travel throughout the bay area! Our incredible community is located conveniently next to the 101 on the peninsula between San Francisco and San Jose. Our residents are close to schools, shopping, nature and to the many downtown centers close by. Although it may be easy to want to spend the day at home when living at Avenue Two (with our 24 hour gym, laid back pool area, picnic garden and expansive resident lounge all at your fingertips) you will be in the perfect area to explore the Bay Area. Apply today to lock down the best apartment in the best area before they are all gone!
