This great 1 bedroom unit is located on the West Side of El
Camino, and only 1.5 miles to downtown Redwood City. It is
walkable and bikeable to all major RWC attractions and
employers.
The unit offers a cool mid-century modern feel, with soaring
ceilings and fantastic clerestory windows. Located on the second
floor, it comes with carport parking, tons of storage including a
walk-in-closet, and a balcony. It has wood flooring in the living
room, and tile flooring in the bathroom and kitchen. There are
laundry facilities on site, and the landscaping has recently been
upgraded.
Redwood City is fun, but living downtown can be a challenge.
This unit allows you to take full advantage of what RWC has to
offer, but enjoy a more peaceful and relaxing home life.
1411 Oxford Street is two blocks north of Woodside Ave.
Grocery stores, coffee shops and convenience stores are a short
walk away. Convenient access to highways 101, 280 and 82.
We require a combined monthly income of at least $6,000, a
credit score of at least 625 and a satisfactory background check.
Appointments required. We can show Tuesdays, Thursdays,
Saturdays and Sundays between the hours of 10 and 6 pm.
Please make sure to indicate: how many people; any pets;
