Hello!
Available for rent starting at the beginning of November is a single room in a 3 bedroom apartment. 
About the room/apartment:
The room is a single bedroom with a shared bathroom, and it comes fully furnished (bed, linens, towels, nightstand, dresser, etc.). The common areas also come furnished with everything you need from cups and plates in the kitchen to a couch and flat screen TV in the living room. There is also a washer and dryer in the apartment, and we have a housecleaner that comes once a week which is included in the price of rent - 1,475. 
About the neighborhood:
We are in a safe neighborhood, just across the street from Google. There's plenty of parking on-site. We are close to all major freeways and lots of public transportation (such as VTA and CalTrain). We are in the heart of the Silicon Valley, and getting to any of the tech companies in the surrounding area is a breeze!
Need more info?:
If this sounds like a living situation you'd be interested in, I'd love to set up a time to show you the place (we can show via Skype if you aren't in the area). Lots of roommates come from out of the area (or even out of the country), so this will give you a chance to see the room prior to putting down a deposit. Feel free to reach out via email with any additional questions - I'm very responsive.
Thanks!
