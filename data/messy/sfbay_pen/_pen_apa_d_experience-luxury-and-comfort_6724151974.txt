Hey, I'm looking for a roommate to occupy a single room in foster city, the ideal place for sporty living. The complex includes unbeatable utilities, such as a swimming pool, a round-the-clock fitness center, and a yoga room.There's also a dedicated grilling area outside for those smoky barbeques on weekends. The place is near coyote park recreation area, which is an exemplary location for bird watching and aircraft spotting. The apartment neighborhood ensures easy living, no hassle if you run out of groceries as there's a target and a costco nearby. There's also starbucks and penelope's coffee and tea near the apartment for those lazy afternoons spent amidst the aroma of freshly-baked bread.
