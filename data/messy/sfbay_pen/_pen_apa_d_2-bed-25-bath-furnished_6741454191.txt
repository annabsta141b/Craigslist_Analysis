Hi - We own a beautifully maintained spacious 2 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom condo just West of 101, moments away from downtown Palo Alto.  The place is a 2-story fully furnished unit, including furniture, linens, TV, dishes and cookware. All small appliances are included (Tasso coffee maker, toaster oven, kettle, etc) as well as a workout bench, bike pump, aerobed. There is a ton of storage in an accessible attic and big closets in each room as well as on the main floor.   And two balcony/patio areas perfect to enjoy the fresh air or do some grilling.  The kitchen was  renovated with granite counter tops and beautiful mosaic tile backsplash; electric stove, dish washer, fridge and new sink & faucet; dishes, utensils, and basic cookware and bakeware. This could be the perfect place for a Stanford graduate student or AWS/Facebook/Google employee who wants to live close to campus, but does not want to purchase their own furniture. 
I'm a very welcoming and accommodating person and landlord. Hope to hear from a down-to-earth young professional, student(s), or responsible couple or family who I can trust to enjoy our place and furnishings. No pets, no smokers, no drugs! 
Available now, looking to lease for at least a year but flexible.
Please email me if you're interested and tell me a little about yourself.
