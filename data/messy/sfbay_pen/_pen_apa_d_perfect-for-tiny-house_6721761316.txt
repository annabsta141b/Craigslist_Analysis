Brand new studio home, just built. This apartment has all new appliances and has its own patio which serves as a second entrance. This home includes washer and dryer in unit. It is located on the ground level and assigned parking is included.
Located next to the Costco and Trader Joe's here in the base of the San Bruno Mountain. Feel like you're outside of all the hustle and bustle, and yet just a 21 BART ride into the City! Our apartment homes get lots of light, and have all the conveniences of a home.
