I have a fully furnished bedroom in my 2 bedroom apartment available immediately. It's fully furnished with a queen bed, desk, dresser, mini-fridge, closet storage, night stand, flat screen TV, and all the necessities. 
Close to San Bruno Bart station and Tanforan Shopping Center on the border of South San Francisco and San Bruno. All the food, grocery and shopping needs are within walking distance. In a quiet, respectable building with secure entry, street parking (unless you want to pay more for a space in our lot). Nice outdoor patio area, 1st Floor, laundry down the hall, very friendly neighbors. 
I'm a Human and Organizational Development Consultant, 33, gay, single, white, and like to maintain a clean, quiet space. 
1 bath to share, kitchen is always fully stocked, but it's expected that you replenish and be a solid roomie when it comes to expenses. WiFi and electric is included, I have a PS4 and XBox One, Apple TV, Piano, and other stuff you're welcome to use with care. 
Hit me up if you're interested. $1,500 deposit and first months rent due at move in. $3,000 moves you in.
