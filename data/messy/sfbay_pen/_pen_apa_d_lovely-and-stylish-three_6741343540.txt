This three-bedroom and two-bathroom home is located in a private street in Belmont Shores. It is a twenty-four-minute walk to downtown Belmont and a twenty-two-minute walk from the Limited and the Local at the Belmont Caltrain stop, close to farmer's market and is surrounded by top-rated schools. This home was recently upgraded from the carpet to the interior and exterior paint. The beautiful open-concept kitchen consists of brand new stainless steel appliances, Corian countertops and backsplash, and a very spacious pantry. The living room and dining area is layered with hardwood flooring and features a fireplace and a high vaulted ceiling. Thanks to carefully-placed lighting fixtures and huge windows that allow ample natural light to enter, the place feels bright and sun-filled during the day yet still well-lit at night.
