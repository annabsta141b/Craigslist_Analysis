OLD MOUNTAIN VIEW! This apartment in a ONE-STORY building in a very private garden setting is just steps from all the action on Castro Street and downtown Mountain View. It is also less than half a block from a large park.
The sliding glass living room door leads out to your own private fenced yard.  The only access to this yard is from your living room, not from your front door.  Therefore, there's no gate for anyone to open and let your pet out.
We recently installed a new fence as well as a new wall heater, a new patio door and a new bedroom window,
