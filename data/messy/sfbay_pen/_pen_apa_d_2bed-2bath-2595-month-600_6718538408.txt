I am moving out of state and I am subleasing my home. I and my family definitely enjoyed living here. The new tenant can move in the weekend of Nov 3, 2018. The lease ends on Feb 13, 2019. 
It is in Sahara Mobile Village, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, spacious kitchen, 2 car garage. This is a home unit and you are not going to share any walls with anybody (as in the pictures). 
Interested parties can come see it any time but still have to go through the usual application process to rental office. Once the lease changes hands, you will be responsible for the monthly rent. 
The current rate for the new units is $2995. Mine is $2795. I am offering $200 off every month ($600 total). So the new tenant will pay $2595 monthly until Feb 2019. After Feb. 2019, there will be a modest increase in rent. 
This is a great deal for a small family in the heart of MV.
