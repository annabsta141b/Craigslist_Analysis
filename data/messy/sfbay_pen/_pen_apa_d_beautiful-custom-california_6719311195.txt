    OPEN SUNDAY 9/16 3:00 -4:00PM
Tucked away on a tree-lined cul-de-sac in Fair Oaks Acres, this 5bd/5ba custom  California Mission style home custom built in 2013 offers beautiful and expansive spaces in a private setting.
A long gated driveway leads to the welcoming front porch. Upon entry, the light-filled two story staircase opens to a lovely sitting room with see-through/double fireplace to the large dining room beyond. The huge kitchen is well appointed with a six burner Thermador range, drawer style microwave, a large center island with leather finished granite and countertop seating, a desk area, and so much more.  The butler's pantry includes a wine refrigerator and is opposite an enormous pantry.  The kitchen opens to the vast family room with fireplace bookended by wood shelving and a wall of French doors leading to the patio and verdant backyard.  A ground floor suite with French doors and high ceilings plus and mud room complete the main level. 
Upstairs, a huge master suite features two closets, including a generous master closet.  The master bath is a lovely place for repose with a double sink and limestone countertops, a huge jet tub, and a doorless shower.  One additional en-suite, two more bedrooms, one full bath, and a laundry room complete the upstairs. In the backyard, luscious plantings, a generous patio, and a lovely entertainment space under a large oak tree canopy make it an entertainer's dream!
Centrally located on the Peninsula with just a short distance from Hwy 101 and minutes from Facebook, downtown Menlo Park , Palo Alto, Stanford, and more, this very special property is not to be missed!
