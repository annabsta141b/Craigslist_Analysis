This lovely two-bedroom unit is located in the Crestmoor neighborhood in San Bruno. Enjoy a beautiful scenic garden view as the building is surrounded by lush green trees and plants. Inside, the floors are carpeted wall-to-wall except for the kitchen/dining area, which is layered with hardwood floor panels. 
The living room is wide and well-lit thanks to tall windows that allow natural light to enter. Adjacent to the living room is the kitchen. It features rustic wooden cupboards, ready-to-use stainless steel appliances, and smooth granite countertops. The master bedroom has access to the balcony outside, and it also has its own small walk-in closet.
