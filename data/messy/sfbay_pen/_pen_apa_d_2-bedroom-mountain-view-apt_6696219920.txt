Relax under the canopy of this cute tree-lined street. Caltrain and MV's downtown area Castro Street are close-by, where you'll find the best food & drink in the hood. You will also have easy access to the Bayshore, Steven's Creek, and Southbay Freeways. If outdoor fitness is your thing throw on some kicks and check out nearby parks and tennis courts, or jog over to Shoreline Park by the Googleplex.
Rate for first month only. Furnished apartment for short term rental.
