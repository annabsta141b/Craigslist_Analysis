Vacant, cleaned, and available now on a first come first served basis. Perhaps Pacifica's largest and best huge 1 bedroom 1 bath apartment including a fireplace and private enclosed garage. Large living room with vaulted ceiling and lots of natural light, and a wood burning fireplace; huge master bedroom approximately 16 x 14 with two large closets; large gas kitchen with lots of wood cabinets, counter tops, full size refrigerator, and room for a dining room table; a private deck off of the dining area and kitchen; large full bath with a shower over the tub, and a private enclosed oversized garage with remote controlled remote opener. Lots of closet and storage space. 
Looking for a responsible, non-smoking, long-term occupant. Sorry, but there is a no pet policy, and a credit check is required. Located in quite modern building with lots of privacy. There is a coin operated laundry room, and water and trash is included.
