Apt. 537 is available November 29th and it's worth the wait.
Top Floor 1 bed in a 3 story building (with elevators). This 1 bedroom apt. has 15 ft. vaulted ceiling in the living room!  This beautiful apt. is facing East, and gets plenty of morning light and has a relaxing view of our pool, and on a clear day all the way to the East bay hills.  Laurel Crossing is a park like community of 22 acres and very pet friendly.  If you like mature trees, open grassy areas that are also near food, shopping, and public transit then Laurel Crossing is for you.
Our top floor apt.'s are our most desirable and apt. 537 is one of my favorites.  This apt. is available on 
Nov. 29th.  We have two pools a fitness center and two tennis courts for fun!  If you have a dog we have doggie stations throughout the community and just next door to our community is a park with a dog park in the back.
