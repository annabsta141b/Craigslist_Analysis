This larger than life 1266 sqft two bedroom is not only a corner apartment but comes with tons of space! Split bedrooms make it perfect for roommates, and you also have a fabulous entertainment style kitchen with fully loaded energy efficient appliance! The cherry on top is our stacked washer/dryer with space for laundry inside your very own home!
Living here at South City you not only get that neighborhood feel of being next to Costco and Trader Joe's, but it's also super easy to get around the Bay! With local highways nearby, and BART a skip across the street. You can sleep in knowing that it's a short walk away from public transport! Or roll out of bed and into our 24/hr fitness centers, for that quick morning workout!
