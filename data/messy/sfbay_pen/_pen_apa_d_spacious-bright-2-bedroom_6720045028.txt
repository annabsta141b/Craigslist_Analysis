	This is one large 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment home! With just over 1010 sq ft, the Seaport gives its resident space and comfort to relax. The remodeled kitchen with new appliances, the wood laminate flooring throughout, and carpeted bedrooms makes this apartment stand out among the rest. Don't miss out on this incredible apartment!
	It's never been easier to travel throughout the bay area! Our incredible community is located conveniently next to the 101 on the peninsula between San Francisco and San Jose. Our residents are close to schools, shopping, nature and to the many downtown centers close by. Although it may be easy to want to spend the day at home when living at Avenue Two (with our 24 hour gym, laid back pool area, picnic garden and expansive resident lounge all at your fingertips) you will be in the perfect area to explore the Bay Area. Apply today to lock down the best apartment in the best area before they are all gone!
