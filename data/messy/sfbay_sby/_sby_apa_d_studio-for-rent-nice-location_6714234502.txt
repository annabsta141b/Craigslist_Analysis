The property is a community of 34 units. This is simply a clean well kept community in a desirable part of Mountain View.
One year lease $2040 / Deposit $1500. Four month lease $2590.

Sorry no pets, and no smokers. You should bring a drivers license or International Passport and checkbook or cash for filling out the application. International residents welcome.
If this ad is posted, the apartment is still available. All apartments come unfurnished. No Dishwashers.
Thank you for your time.
Just a Note: Your location and neighborhood is an important safety factor when researching your apartment. One mile from El Camino Real is a good starting place in Mountain View.
