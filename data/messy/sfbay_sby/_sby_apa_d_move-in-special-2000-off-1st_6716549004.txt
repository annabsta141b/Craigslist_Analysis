After 6 years being a resident in Bella Vista apartments, time has come for us to move out. To avoid our lease breakage penalty, we are offering $2000 to future tenants after they successfully complete the rental process for our apartment to move in by December 1st (the place will be available after Nov. 24th). Please note that this is NOT a sub lease and all the applicants must complete the new application process with Bella Vista management. If you are interested, please contact me for details. 
This is a beautiful 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom unfurnished apartment; 1058 sq. ft. on top level 3rd floor with 1 car garage and a storage unit. The apartment has stainless steel appliances, granite counter tops, washer/drier in unit, fireplace and a balcony. The complex is a gated community and has modern amenities including stunning courtyard pool, spa, 24-hour fitness center and nice BBQ grills.
