As the leaves are falling from all of our community trees, our prices have followed downward.  Get more for your buck and live lavishly in one of beautifully designed floor plans.  With the cold weather approaching fast, our selected units have the perfect amount of comfort. Stay warm by using one of selected wood burning fireplace units!  If you don't like taking groceries out of your car in a cold weather day, don't worry!  Our one or two bedroom town-homes come with an attached garage.  You drive in and the kitchen is only a few steps away.  The weather can also damper your electricity bill but some of our selected villages come with double pane windows. 
 Welcome to sunny California!  Just because the fall is here, doesn't mean the weather is always cold.  We have had multiple sunny days in our San Jose area.  All of our floor plans come with a balcony or patio.  You can entertain your friends or family with a fall BBQ.  With the fair weather months, celebrate a family event in our outdoor BBQ and picnic grassy area.
