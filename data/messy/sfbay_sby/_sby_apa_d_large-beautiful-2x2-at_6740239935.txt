Looking for someone to assume my Lease in a beautiful, quiet, 2 bedroom, two full bathroom apartment. The advantage to you is you recieve my low rent for assuming my lease, and not pay the higher, current rents. 
Full size Washer and Dryer in the unit with lots of storage space (including a large storage unit off your patio).
Granite kitchen countertops, huge bathrooms, large, newly built work out center, swimming pool and hot tub, business lounge, recreation room, beautiful view from top floor balcony and all windows of the fountains, pool, and a little of the hills. Everything is newly built with newer designs, beautiful landscaping and right on the los gatos creek trail!
Deposit is only $950 and the rent is $3319, plus utilities. Includes parking in the parking garage, all sealed and secured with a gate (you get a clicker and an assigned spot). Lease ends on April 1, but you can continue to rent after that on a month to month basis, or sign another lease.
