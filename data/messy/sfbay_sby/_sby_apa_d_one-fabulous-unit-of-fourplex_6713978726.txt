You will be renting one unit of a fabulous fourplex family house. The whole house (inside and outside) has been completely renovated. All four units are 2-bedroom and 1-bathroom, with their own private garage and laundry inside. It is currently the BEST rental apartment on Hamilton Ave, Campbell. 
The unit(Unit#3) has the following features:
1) 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom, 1 kitchen, 1 living room. Plus, you have your own private garage of 220 SqFt (with your own private laundry machines inside)!
2) Completely high-end newly remodeled. EVERYTHING is BRAND NEW: granite counter-top, kitchen cabinets, laminate floors, double-pane windows, doors, LED lights, copper plumbing pipes, walls&painting, electric wires and switches, bathtub, bathroom vanity, shower faucet, stone-tile, etc.

I am looking for a quiet, clean, easy-going and non-smoking tenant with a minimum 1-year lease. You need to have stable income. The security deposit is $3500.
