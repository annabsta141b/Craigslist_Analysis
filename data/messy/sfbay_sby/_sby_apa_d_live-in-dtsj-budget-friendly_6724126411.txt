Take in the Overfelt Gardens or delve into the catacombs of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. library, all from our apartments in San Jose's downtown. Here at Villa Torino, the lifestyle is as smart as the surroundings. Accelerate your work day to dozens of major tech employers; the VTA light rail is located just footsteps away for an easy commute. Are there any downtown San Jose apartments that can match that? Meet your friends at any of the cool pubs and restaurants nearby.
