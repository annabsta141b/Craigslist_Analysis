 DESCRIPTION:  Hearth pairs the resonance of nature with the vibrant warmth of home. It all centers on the holistic rooftop experience: a full-length pool, surrounded by fire pits, gas grills, and an expansive deck. A Neighborhood Lounge which doubles as a flexible common area and hybrid Theater. A powerhouse cardio and strength Fitness Center with vibrant, kinetic design. Everything blended together with a focus on modern technology and natural design. Soon, we'll be welcoming the addition of Hearth South, a new wing of all new apartment homes and amenities. An ultramodern Fitness Center equipped for yoga, Pilates and boot camps-plus a Great Indoors game room, including a surprisingly accurate golf simulator, an HD flat screen TV with seating area, a hammock corner, a handcrafted ping pong table, a chef-ready kitchen, a communal dining area and more.In the heart of Santa Clara, Hearth is on the doorstep of Central Park and a bevy of local faves. It's a place to set down roots and find new beginnings. It's home-and only the starting point. OFFICE HOURS:
