Hi, I'm looking for someone to occupy a private room(with private bathroom) in a 2bed, 2 bath apartment in Santa Clara. 
The apartment is surrounded by  waterscapes and lush gardens. It has 2 swimming pools, jacuzzi, fitness center, Tennis and basketball courts, Vegetable garden, Clubhouse with fireside lounge, Barbecue area, Business center and on-site laundry. You have access to ample parking space. 
Safeway, Chipotle, Peet's Coffee are at a walking distance.
There are trails for walking and jogging. The historic James Lick Mansion is in the backyard(which the apartment has an amazing view of).
Your roommate graduated from SJSU majoring in graphic design. She works in USPS Mon-Sat and has a super hectic work schedule so isn't home much but is a pleasure to share a space with.
Please include a brief bio in your reply for a faster response.
Rent is 1365 + utilities(around 75). Lease will be for a 10 months duration.
