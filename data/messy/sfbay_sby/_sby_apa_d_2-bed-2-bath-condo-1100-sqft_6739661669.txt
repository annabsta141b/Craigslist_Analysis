This lovely two-bedroom and two-bathroom condo unit is located near central San Jose. 
It is within walking distance to CEFCU, SJSU, downtown and minutes to highway 280, 87, 101,680, and 880. With an excellent bike score of 87, owning a bike in this location would be very beneficial. The unit features a well-thought-of floor plan, fresh paint, and well-maintained appliances. The interior boasts full wall-to-wall carpeting for added comfort. Thanks to carefully-placed lighting fixtures and large windows that allow ample natural light to enter, the whole place feels bright and sun-filled during that day yet surprisingly well-lit at night. The beautiful kitchen consists of classic yet stylish wooden cabinets, dark granite countertops and backsplash, and ready-to-use stainless steel GE appliances. For vehicle parking, a two-car secured garage is available. In-unit washer and dryer are also provided.
