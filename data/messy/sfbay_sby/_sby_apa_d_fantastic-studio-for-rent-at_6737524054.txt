Description
  
    Here's a rare opportunity to rent at one of downtown San Jose's most desirable addresses - The 88. There are luxury touches galore, from the beautiful wood floors, to the upscale stainless steel appliances, and natural stone counters in both the kitchen and bathroom.
This studio features a gourmet kitchen with European-style cabinetry, granite slab counters, and stainless steel appliances. The living/dining area has great views overlooking the dome of City Hall and the Eastern foothills.  The sleeping area features dual closets with custom organizers. The bath has a vanity with natural stone counter, a tile surrounded shower over tub, and a tile floor. All the windows in the condo have full-length window coverings. And there is in-unit full-sized front loading washer and dryer as well.
The 88 is the epitome of upscale urban living. It's conveniently located in the heart of downtown San Jose. Great restaurants, vibrant nightlife, sports and concerts at the San Jose Arena, world-class theater, and seasonal entertainment and special events are steps away from your front door.  The Safeway Market can be found at the ground level of The 88. Amenities abound at The 88 - concierge and security service, a modern fitness center, and a fifth floor entertainment oasis that includes both indoor and outdoor experiences. Outdoors you'll find a swimming pool and hot tub, a barbeque area with plenty of seating for dining, and comfortable lounge areas with lovely views of downtown. Inside is a lounge area surrounding a flat-screen TV, fireplace, and a full kitchen. Also available to residents is the 21st floor Skyline Observation Terrace - a unique indoor and outdoor space with spectacular views from the highest residential building between San Francisco and Los Angeles.  
Parking at The 88 is in a secured garage. The condo comes with one parking space. Transportation options are many - San Jose's Diridon Station is blocks away with Caltrain and VTA Light Rail options, and highways 87, 880 and 280 are minutes away by car.
Be the envy of your friends. Be at The 88.
