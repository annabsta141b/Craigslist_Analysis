In the heart of downtown Mountain View, Glenwood Garden offers the best of location and amenities. Our remodeled units feature upgraded carpet and vinyl. Granite countertops and open beam ceilings (in some units) give the wide floor plans a unique and modern look. Large balconies boast views of both the surrounding green hills and our landscaped courtyard, with swimming pool, BBQ and picnic areas that pair perfectly with warm weather. The complex provides covered assigned parking in a controlled-access lot, and our laundry facility is coinless and convenient.
Located on the beautiful tree-lined street of Calderon Avenue, we have quick and easy access to Highways 82 and 85. The Mountain View Caltrain Station is within a short walking distance, and a quick commute brings you to the Google and Stanford campuses and the thriving nightlife of Downtown Mountain View.
