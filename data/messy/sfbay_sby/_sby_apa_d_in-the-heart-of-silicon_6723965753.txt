     DESCRIPTION The Britton Park Apartments are a beautiful, well maintained complex near major electronics and high tech industries.
This is a spacious remodeled 1BR/1BA  apartment.  It features a large living room, an all electric kitchen, a dining area and a full bath off the bedroom.  The location is extremely convenient since parking is very close to the unit.
The Britton Park Apartments are a dog and cat friendly building. (Each potential new animal will be "interviewed" by the manager.)
