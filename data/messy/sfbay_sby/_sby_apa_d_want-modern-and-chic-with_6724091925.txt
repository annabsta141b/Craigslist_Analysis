 Property Description  From the moment you enter this one-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment at Spruce Apartments, the faux-hardwood flooring and open-concept design stands out, alongside the striking finishes! The U-shaped kitchen has a complete stainless steel appliance package, and the sturdy quartz counters extend to the breakfast bar. The adjacent living and dining area comes designed with a stackable washer and dryer tucked away in a laundry closet. This floor plan also incorporates spacious closets and a private balcony that overlooks the mature trees in the neighborhood. Get outside and enjoy the California sunshine by swimming laps in the heated pool or getting some cardio on the volleyball and tennis courts.
