       DESCRIPTION    

The Britton Park Apartments are a beautiful, well maintained complex near major electronics and high tech industries.

This is a spacious remodeled 3BR/1BA upstairs apartment.  It features a large living room, an all electric kitchen, a dining area and a full bath.  The upstairs location is extremely quiet since there is no apartment above you.  Parking is very close to the unit



The Britton Park Apartments are a dog and cat friendly building. (Each potential new animal will be "interviewed" by the manager.)
