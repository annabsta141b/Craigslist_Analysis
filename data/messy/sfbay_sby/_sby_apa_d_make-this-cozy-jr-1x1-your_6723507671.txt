Our property offers our residents with luxury living and amenities without losing the convenience of being close to everything. We are at the corner of Morse Avenue and Toyama Drive and within walking distance to Tasman Light Rail and minutes to Routes 101 and 237. We have spectacular on-site amenities that will allow you to have that fun, active lifestyle you have been dreaming of. Enjoy a game of tennis on one of our two lighted courts, take a dip in one of our three refreshing pools and hot tubs or take in an invigorating workout in our fitness center or racquetball court.
At this time, we have a 1 bedroom, Sonoma floor plan available. This cozy one-bedroom apartment is the perfect starter home! Its open, airy interior living space is great for entertaining guests and family. Enjoy meals on the go at the convenient breakfast bar or use it as a buffet during social gatherings. The modern kitchen features energy efficient appliances and gorgeous cabinetry. Retreat on nice days to your own private terrace and take in the fresh air and warm, California sun! You will love the privacy of your bedroom with attached bath and huge walk-in closet.
