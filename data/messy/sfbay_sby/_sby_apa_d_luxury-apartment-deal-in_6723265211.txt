We are moving from Mountain View to San Francisco at the end of the month because of work. Our current lease ends in June 2019, and we are looking for someone to take over the lease from November 2018 to June 2019, with the option to renew it. This is not a sublet - you will sign a lease directly with the Village Residences.
