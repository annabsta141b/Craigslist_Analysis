This home is in a great location, close to major freeways, tech companies, shopping, and parks. Google, Oracle, and Cisco HQs are just a few tech cos within arm's reach. Levi's Stadium (home of the 49ers!) and Great America (thrill rides and high fives) are close enough you can smell the hot dogs and hear the cheers. Get outdoors and take a stroll on the Guadalupe Trail, which follows the Guadalupe River through downtown San Jose. 
Assigned spaces are $50/mo
Rate for first month only. Furnished apartment for short term rental.
