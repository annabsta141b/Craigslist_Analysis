My parents want to rent one of their bedrooms for $1000 per month. The room is new with wood floors. The fee includes internet, water and electricity, shared bathroom. We will offer you a small refrigerator for use. They prefer the people who can speak Chinese because my parents can't speak English. Only walk 3 minutes to the nearest bus stop, 5 minutes to the light rail station and 15 minutes to the nearest supermarket. Please send me a brief introduction of yourself if you're interested.
