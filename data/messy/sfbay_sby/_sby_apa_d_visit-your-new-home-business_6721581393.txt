The Flats is a highly anticipated and brand new ultra-luxurious apartment community in downtown Sunnyvale. The Flats has taken luxury to a new level in apartment living and the fit and finish is beyond what you would expect in apartment living. We are now accepting reservations for our first release of apartment homes with move ins beginning in late October. You can be the first to live in your brand new home, but our selections are filling up quickly. We do still have a variety of floorplans to choose from including, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom and 3 bedroom floorplans. 
 Our location is in the heart of Sunnyvale and you can walk out your front door and walk to downtown Sunnyvale within minutes. In fact, there are dozens of restaurants, cafes and coffee shops that are just steps away. We have plenty of parking, but you can walk to Cal-Train from our community. We are a commuter's dream and only minutes from Hwy 101 and 280. We love our 4 legged residents and welcome them as well. 
 Please call today for a tour of our amazing community. You can also check us out online at https://www.citylineflats.com
