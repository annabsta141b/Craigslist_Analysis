Breathe in the fresh air from your large private patio.
Feel the warmth of light from generous floor-to-ceiling windows in your new North San Jose apartment home. Enjoy your morning coffee as the sun comes up and the city awakens. Relax with a cocktail, or glass of wine, as the night cools down and the North San Jose city lights illuminate the urban landscape. (And, for a bit of privacy, you can always lower the Vertilux Solar Screens) This apartment requires a $500 deposit.
