The Standard is the perfect place to live on-the-go in a Silicon Valley neighborhood you can really make your own. Whether you're a techie whose second home is at your startup, an art lover who dreams of galleries and First Fridays, or an oenophile who never misses a Lincoln Avenue Wine Walk, you've found a spot that reflects all the best parts about living in Willow Glen. With a rooftop deck, a party room and easy access to the light rail, the amenities here are anything but Standard. This is more than just a place for you to lay your head - This is home.
