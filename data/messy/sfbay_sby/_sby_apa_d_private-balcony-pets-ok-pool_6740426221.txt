     DESCRIPTION     The Bascom Holiday Apartments are a quiet, well maintained community near major electronic and high tech industries.
This spacious upstairs remodeled 1BR/1BA apartment features a large living room, kitchen, master bedroom, and a full bath.  The living room opens onto your private balcony.  Your 1 bedroom apartment is quieter than normal since there is no one above you.

The landlord pays for gas and electricity (currently a $73/per month savings to the resident). Landlord pays for normal water and garbage collection.

 
MAJOR SHOPPING NEARBY: The small shops along Bascom Avenue are a short walk.  The Valley Fair Shopping Center offers world class shopping.  Nearby Mercado Shopping Center and Vallco Fashion Park offer extensive shopping opportunities.
The Bascom Holiday is a dog and cat friendly building.  (Each potential new animal will be "interviewed" by the manager.)
