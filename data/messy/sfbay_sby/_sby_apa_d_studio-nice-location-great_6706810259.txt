I am a property manager looking to fill a large 525sq. Ft studio / 1 bath. The Apartment is in a desirable upscale Mountain View location. Our prices are low, so we stay full. 1.1 miles from Google. 
The property is a community of 20 units. This is simply a clean well kept community in a great part of Mountain View.
One year lease $1850 / Deposit $1500. Four month lease $2590.

If this ad is posted, the apartment is still available. All apartments come unfurnished. No Dishwashers.
Thank you for your time.
