Hello Future Flatmate,
A little bit about me:
I am a 33-year old employed full-time. I like to go on hikes with my dog, spend time with my family, and change my hairstyle quite often. I am not a neat freak, but I do care about keeping common areas of the home neat and clean. I love arts & crafts, jazz festivals, and museums. I have a 20 lbs. mutt who is the friendliest little guy you'll ever meet.
About You:
I would like a flatmate (as in, you'll have your own room in the apartment) who works full-time (not from home). Enjoys nature, taking care of the environment (reduce waste, reuse, recycle), open-minded, and looking for a long-term accommodation (within reason) who enjoys socializing but has their own life.
