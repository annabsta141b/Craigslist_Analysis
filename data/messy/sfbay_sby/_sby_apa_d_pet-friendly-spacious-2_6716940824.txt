Hi guys,
As we are moving to a new location for work, we are searching for someone to take over next 6 month lease. The apartment is pet friendly, spacious, 2 bedroom 1 bathroom.
The benefit of taking the lease from us is that your income is going to be added to ours when applying. Normally, management companies require pay stubs showing the monthly income of 2-3 times the monthly rent. This wouldn't be the case this time, making it easier for you to get the apartment.

Central Expy, 101, El Camino Real, San Tomas Expy,
Triton Museum of Art,
Rotary Park,
Santa Clara Chamber of Commerce,
