 If you're looking for a 3-bedroom home, you've found it. We have a second floor three-bedroom that is aching to meet you. It boasts easy street access, and covered enclosed garage parking directly below. It has a full sized washer and dryer in the unit and ceilings so high you would need a ladder to touch them. The open floorplan and bar-height counter in the kitchen is perfect for entertaining, or just enjoying your own time at home. Three equal sized bedrooms each have walk-in closets, and three bathrooms (two masters) that will make everyone feel at home in their own space. Energy efficient dual-pane windows cut out outside noise and help keep energy costs low. Not to mention the jaw dropping renovation. All of that and just a few minutes' walk to shopping, dining, and entertainment. When you walk in the door, you'll see why so many people choose to call Willow Lake their home.
