Beautiful pool facing 1bed/1bath apartment in Santa Clara's Rivermark area up for a brand new lease starting 09 Dec 2018. I currently live here but I need to break my lease and hence I'm looking for somebody to occupy the house after me. This is NOT a sublet. You will have to sign a new lease with the apartment community.
