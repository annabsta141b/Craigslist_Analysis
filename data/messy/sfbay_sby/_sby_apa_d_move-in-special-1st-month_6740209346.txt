After 6 years being a resident in Bella Vista apartments, time has come for us to move out. To avoid our lease break penalty, we are offering 1 month rent of $3090 to future tenants after they successfully complete the rental/leasing process for our apartment by Nov. 15th. The place is available to move in Nov. 23rd. Please note that this is NOT a sub lease and all the applicants must complete the new application process with Bella Vista management. If you are interested, please contact me for details. 
This is a beautiful 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom unfurnished apartment; 1058 sq. ft. on top level 3rd floor with 1 car garage and a storage unit. The apartment has stainless steel appliances, granite counter tops, washer/drier in unit, fireplace and a balcony. The complex is a gated community and has modern amenities including stunning courtyard pool, spa, 24-hour fitness center and nice BBQ grills.
