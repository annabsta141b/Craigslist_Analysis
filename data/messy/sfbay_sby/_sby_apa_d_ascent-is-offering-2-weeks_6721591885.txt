Ascent is a place where thoughtful architecture and design provides the foundation for comfort and luxury. A concept derived from the juxtaposition of mid-century modern design combined with the connectivity of today's most modern conveniences. Ascent portrays the modernism of 1950's California architecture reflective of the former Hitachi campus and incorporates fresh ideas true to a mid-century living environment, allowing for fresh, innovative and vivid features.
Ascent's distinct blend of bold colors, clean lines, and abundant natural lighting provides a comforting feeling of openness and mobility. You will appreciate the revival of mid-century design through the harmonious proportions and geometric patterns appropriately placed throughout the property. From the dramatized entrances, the park on the green, and the large tensile structures, the memorable elements and meticulous attention to detail emphasize the timeless beauty of the design. Attentive strokes of red spread throughout the property serve as a striking core to the distinct color pallet, offering each area a trendy, artistic component.
Residents have multiple ways to interact with each other through strategically placed gathering places and high tech amenities. Ascent redefines apartment living with its eclectic eco-friendly combination of contemporary styling with a historic basis. The property is 100% smoke-free and the interior spaces are well-designed and exquisitely decorated, bright and spacious - this is inspired living!
