The studio apartment has its own gas and electric meters(tenant pays).  This is a legal apartment with its own  kitchen and bath.  I pay for hot and cold water and garbage.  The apartment has central heat and air condition unit in the window.  Prefer single person due to size of the unit and the price I'm charging.  The apartment is vacant. 
PLEASE LEAVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER SO I CAN CALL YOU BACK.
