This apartment is located at 743 Golden Oak CT, Sunnyvale, Ca 94086.
It's very easy to walk to bus stop, CVS, Walgreens or Safeway and also just 5 mins away from downtown Sunnyvale if you drive. Very easy to get to Costco and Ranch 99. This apartment comes with 2 assigned parking spots and also street parking if you have additional cars.
Since I got a job offer at another city that I have to move. My lease term will be continued till the end of August 2019.
To be honest, it's an pretty old apartment. I don't wanna make you disappointed since it doesn't come with community.
If you're still interested in this good price 2 bedrooms apartment please reach me at  show contact info
 or email me to make an appointment.
