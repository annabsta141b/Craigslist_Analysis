3 bedroom, 2.5 bath, 1900 square feet, 2 car garage, end unit townhome - RIVERMARK

We're renting a gorgeous 3 Bedroom, 2.5 bath extremely well-maintained townhouse in the Rivermark neighborhood of Santa Clara.  The Rivermark shopping mall is within 2 blocks' walking distance, as is the swimming pool, park, library, and Don Callejon K-8 public school. It's a great neighborhood and the home was built in 2005. 

If you're familiar with the townhouse models in the area, this is the end-unit Savannah model, approximately 1900 square feet  (largest floor plan for townhouses in the area). There is a very spacious 2 car garage with ample storage space.   We have hardwood floors in the family room and dining room, tiles in the kitchen and all bathrooms, and carpeting in the bedrooms and living room.  Stove, dishwasher, and refrigerator are all high-end stainless steel appliances.  Clothes washer and dryer are located upstairs (bedroom level) which is REALLY convenient.

The family room is pre-wired for surround sound and the house also has ethernet jacks throughout. The house also has an alarm system.  The neighbors on all sides are great ... and the shared wall is extremely well sound insulated. 

The rent for this townhouse is only $4200 per month.  Your move-in cost is the 1st month's rent and a security deposit of $5000.  The lease is for 12 months or more.  Pets and smoking not allowed, sorry. Ready to show immediately.
If you'd like to get an idea of the layout view all the pictures in the gallery, we've included the floor plan as well.
