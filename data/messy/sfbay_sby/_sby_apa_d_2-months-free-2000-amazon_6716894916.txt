Now open for tours! Situated on the outskirts of the San Jose area, Campbell retains a distinctly small-town environment while allowing convenient access to the bigger cities nearby. Downtown San Jose and the airport are less than 15 minutes away via I-880, and even San Francisco is only about an hour's drive up I-280. It would be easy to think of Campbell as just a commuter suburb, but in reality the city has tons of personality. The community loves to throw outdoor events throughout the year, ensuring that there is always something to do when you live in a Campbell apartment. The local parks provide excellent venues for outdoor fun and recreation, and if you really want to get out into nature there are thousands of acres of nature preserves just west of the city limits.
