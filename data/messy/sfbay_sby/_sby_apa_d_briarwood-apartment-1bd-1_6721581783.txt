I am looking for an apartment mate to split up a 2 bed 2.5 bath location in Sunnyvale. 
This location is within walking distance to the Caltrain, so it's a great option for someone who is interested in using public transit to move around.
The apartment is two floors and the rent will be $1620. The move-in date is Oct 16th, but I will probably not be in Sunnyvale until Oct 27th.

I am 30 years old mail, a non-smoker, and I do not own any pets. I am moving to the area to start a job in Mountain View as a Data Scientist with a genetic testing company. I was previously employed as a Bioinformatician at Scripps Research in San Diego.
I am looking for someone who is clean, educated, and financially responsible. There is an extra $25/mon parking fee if you have a car.
