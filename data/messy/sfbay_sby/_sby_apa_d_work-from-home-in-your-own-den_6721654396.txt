Website: http://prometheus.apartments/infoCupertinoParkCenterAddress: 20380 Stevens Creek Boulevard Cupertino, CA 95014  Plan 1E  1  bed / 1 bath / 1078 Sq.Ft / $3,475 - $3,848 * Unit 139 - Available Now * Unit 240 - Available 11/17/18  Cupertino Park Center apartments are Silicon Valley chic.  Living in the heart of the action has its advantages. You're never far from something to do or somewhere new to check out. Being downtown means you're at the center of it all. And that's a great place to be. Smack down in the middle of Silicon Valley, you're a hop, skip and a jump to over 60 of the world's most renowned high-tech business leaders like Apple, HP and Symantec. And that's exactly why you moved here, to be in the center of it all. But with a nearby Whole Foods, shopping galore and some of the best restaurants in the valley (like Pan Tao, home of amazing dim sum) this feels more like the center of the universe.
