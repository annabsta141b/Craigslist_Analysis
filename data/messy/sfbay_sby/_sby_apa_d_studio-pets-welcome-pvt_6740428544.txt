This up stairs remodeled Studio/1BA apartment features a large living area, kitchen, and a full bath.  The living area opens onto your private balcony.  Your Studio apartment is quieter than normal since there is no one above you.
 
















The Bascom Holiday is a dog and cat friendly building.  (Each potential new animal will be "interviewed" by the manager.)

 

The resident pays PG&E for electricity.   Landlord pays for gas heat. A savings of $36/per month!  Landlord pays for normal water and garbage collection.  

Resident will open an account with PG&E for electricity  only.
