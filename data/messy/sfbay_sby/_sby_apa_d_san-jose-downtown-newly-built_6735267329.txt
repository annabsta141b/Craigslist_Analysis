Beautiful newly built condo in downtown San Jose.  
This is a very spacious 600 sqf 1bd/1ba unit, in a gated apartment building.  It is located in a mature neighborhood, with walking distance to local elementary school, shops, and restaurants.  New kitchen comes with all new appliances.  
No pet please. 
Will provide pictures based on serious inquiries.
