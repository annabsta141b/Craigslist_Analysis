A gorgeous, large, 2 bedroom, 2 bath corner unit vaulted ceilings in the living, dining, and master bedroom. This 1,241 sqft third floor condo is upgraded and taken care of, and is just the place to live for a starting family. 
The elegant kitchen has been upgraded custom cherry cabinets with a built in wine rack, stainless steel appliances, granite counter top, and breakfast bar. Everything is in top grade and shape, from the granite, to the recessed lighting in the ceiling and in the cabinets, and even under the breakfast bar. 
Baths also have custom cherry cabinets & granite counter tops. Top of the line Kohler toilets and new nickel faucets. New vertical and horizontal window blinds and newer carpet throughout the living area. Dual-paned windows, in-unit laundry room, unused wood burning fireplace. Dishwasher, trash compactor, disposal, washer, dryer are all there.
The gated community is always in pristine condition, from the elevators to the pool and the gardens, and you get two spots in the underground parking garage. Very close to SJSU and SJ DT and Santana Row, and to several major highways (101, 280, 680, 17, 87) to get you anywhere in the bay area. 
I also have homeowner's warranty for it, so if anything goes wrong, you just make a phone call to the warranty company and it's solved. I do require you to get renter's insurance, to cover your side of things (in case you break something and so it's not covered by the warranty). 
The deal is simple: top quality apartment for average rent but only for renters who will take good care of it. This apartment was modeled for the owner to live in (not the low quality, rental property material), and we want to make sure it's enjoyed as well as maintained well when rented out. 
The average rent close to DT for apartments that are 1,200-1,300 sqft is $3,250 ($3,040-$3,499). This apartment is way above average quality, but if you're the right people to take care of it, you can have a top quality apartment for $3,200 a month. Like I said, top end apartment for average pay for the responsible renter who knows how to enjoy a place and take care of it, too.
