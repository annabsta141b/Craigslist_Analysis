I am renting a charming self contained one bedroom apartment on the second floor of my private house, access to the apartment is separate from the rest of the house and is up an outside staircase . The house is situated on two beautiful acres on the outskirts of Fallbrook with lovely forever views towards the ocean, it is a great place to walk, hike and bike and the Santa Margaretta Nature Reserve and river are just below the house. It is quiet, private and safe. 
Two miles into Town (Fallbrook) and two miles to the freeway 1-15.
There are laundry facilities, part utilities are paid, apartment comes furnished or unfurnished and there is off street parking for one car.
Please send an email with a little information about yourself, how old you are, where you work, how long you have worked there, if you intend sharing the apartment with someone else and if you have a pet. 
ONE person occupancy only, sorry, no exceptions.
Must work full time off site.
NO smoking or drugs and sorry no pets.
If this ad is running then the apartment is still for rent.
