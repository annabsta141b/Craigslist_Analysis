Great Location to the Bay in Crown Point!
This adorable one bedroom cottage/duplex has beautiful Hardwood floors, appliances, and a coin laundry facility on site which makes this unit complete. You can step out and walk a couple blocks to the Bay Park for an afternoon picnic or just sit and watch the boats go by. This apartment is also close to shopping and restaurants. Paid utilities would include water and trash. Garage parking. Sorry No Pets and No smoking
