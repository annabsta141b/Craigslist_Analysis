This charming apartment is located in a quieter area of North Park, close to the South Park border. The complex was originally built to house visiting dignitaries for the Panama-California Exposition of 1915 and features beautiful Spanish style architecture. Original hardwood floors run throughout the unit, and a Jack-and-Jill bathroom connects the two bedrooms. While still maintaining its turn-of-the-century charm, the apartment has been updated and remodeled. All kitchen appliances are new (including a dishwasher and gas stove). One off-street parking spot is provided with the unit, and additional street parking is generally plentiful. Laundry is available on site. This unit is located downstairs with only one adjacent neighbor and is available for immediate move-in.
Located on the northern end of Switzer Canyon, a short walk will take you to the countless restaurants, bars, and breweries in either North Park or South Park. The location also provides easy driving access to freeways, downtown, and the airport. Tenant to pay all utilities. Deposit is one month's rent, lease term is flexible but a 9-month lease is preferred. We will be showing the unit by appointment only this weekend.
