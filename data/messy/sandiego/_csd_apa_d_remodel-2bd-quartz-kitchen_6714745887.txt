here is your warning... the complex is full of drunks and tweekers... parking sucks if you have more than 1 car and that will get broken into or stolen... the noise from the freeway is horrendous!! even with double pane windows it still is like your windows are open even though they are shut... so you will have to run the AC a lot of the time because unless you are on the bottom floor the apartment is unbearably warm even in the winter... and OMG $1750 a month is crazy... my rent was $1200 and it is not worth it so I moved... so they throw a new paint job and some carpet and counter tops and bump it up $550 a month more??? also they are shutting the water off all the time for repairs with no notice and on the hot water is a crap shoot... some times you have it and some times you don't... and your water bill will be high!!! you are billed on the "RUBS Utility Billing" well when more that half of the apartments have 1 or more people living in them that are not on the lease you are paying for all that extra water use... I lived in a 4 bed 2.5 bath house with a large front and back yard and paid less for water than here by 40%
