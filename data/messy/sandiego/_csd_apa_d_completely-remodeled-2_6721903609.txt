This is a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment in a quiet and secure 7 unit complex.  Apartment has never been upgraded and after long term tenants moved out it was time for a complete overhaul.  Unit was torn down to the studs and EVERYTHING was remodeled. Everything is brand new including floors, cabinets/counters, electrical, plumbing, windows, paint, etc. This is a downstairs unit with private back patio and one car garage.  Also includes one parking space off the street in driveway in front of garage. Building has long term tenants, is quiet, gated, and secure. Easy access to 15 and 8 freeways. Unit is almost complete just a few more final details and should be ready for move in by October 15th.  We do not allow smokers. No Pets. Security deposit is $2000.  If you are interested or would like to view the unit, please email Danny to set up a showing.
