Welcome to Elan City Lofts in Banker's Hill. That's another name for the gorgeous downtown community of Park West. Located west of the beautiful and historic Balboa Park, this oasis of a community got the name Banker's Hill because it was home to the wealthier of San Diego's residents. This hilltop enclave overlooking San Diego Bay still looks and plays the part. With spectacular 200-year-old estates built by some of the most famous architects of the day. In a quiet residential complex community walking distance from cafes, casual dining, upscale award winning restaurants, nightclubs and art galleries for the frequent flier the close proximity to the airport is a plus. But anyone can take a trip to Park West and enjoy the popular past-time of watching the planes go by.
