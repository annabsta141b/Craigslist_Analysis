Due to a personal matter I need to relocate as soon as possible. My current lease ends on 4/4/2019. I am looking for someone to apply and take over my lease. Market rent is $1275.00 plus utilities but my rent IS ONLY $1195.00 PLUS UTILITIES. Applicant must qualified. Deposit on approved credit is $750.00 but if you take over my lease we can negotiate how much deposit you need to pay. Remember my rent is already cheaper than if you were coming in brand new.
