I have loved living in this beautiful condo and the Little Italy neighborhood. The condo is open, roomy, and gets great natural light. There is a large stainless steel kitchen that opens into the living room and balcony overlooking the pool. Granite counter tops & newer wood laminate floors complete the sleek look of this home.
