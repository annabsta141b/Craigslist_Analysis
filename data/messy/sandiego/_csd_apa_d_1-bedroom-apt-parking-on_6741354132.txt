Nice 1 bedroom apartment in a very walk-able area on the north side of pacific beach... within a short walk of pretty much everything PB has to offer; yet the apartment is very quite and peaceful.  This apartment is smaller in size but has a functional floor plan with a kitchen bar area that will allow for a couple bar-stools.  This is a downstairs apartment with vinyl plank flooring, the apartment also includes a small A/C window unit and a ceiling fan in the living room.  The apartment is located in a small 20 unit community called Erin Manor which is a garden style building with lots of greenery, a pool in the center courtyard, a laundry room, each apartment comes with a small storage locker and 1 off-street parking space.
