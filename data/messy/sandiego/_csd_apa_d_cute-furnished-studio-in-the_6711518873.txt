Cozy studio in the heart of the charming Little Italy, San Diego. This is a three storied house. I am renting the studio in the bottom floor. The bottom floor has a studio; your own bedroom, bathroom, and walk-in closet. You will have the entire floor by yourself and I only share the entrance with you as I live in the second floor. So basically I would post it as an entire place if there was another entrance. The location is amazing; it is a walking distance to all famous restaurants and bars in Little Italy and Gaslamp. Also, the ocean is only three block away. The train station (Trolley) is a block away. Also, taxi and Uber are minutes away at all times.
I am looking to rent the studio to an international/exchange student, because it is an ideal place for them.
