Lovely updated two bedroom apartment with one garage space, laundry, beautiful outdoor common area space, and is available December 5th.  Can't tell you how beautiful this property is.  Within ear shot of the great Pacific ocean, breathe in the fresh ocean air.  Stroll to local area businesses, Pilates class, Wellness Center, or have a cup of joe in the morning with the neighbors.  Did I mention the sunsets?!  Clean, well maintained property, looking for solid long term residents.  Sorry no pets.  Photos are of the upstairs mirror unit but are a true representative of the condition and charm of the available unit, only exception is that there is carpeting.  Unit professionally cleaned before move in.  Square footage listed below is my best guess.
