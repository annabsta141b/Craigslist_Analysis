NON FURNISHED
Attached Studio unit with its own iron gate side entrance. My wife and I live in the main house with two medium size Dogs (Corgis). We are young professionals who work 9-5 during the week. The studio would be ideal for a
student since it is only about a mile away from SDSU.
Safe and quiet neighborhood.  We have front and rear flood light security cameras (Ring camera system) for added safety.
