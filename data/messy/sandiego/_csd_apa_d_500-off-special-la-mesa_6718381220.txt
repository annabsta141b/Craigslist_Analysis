Don't do your laundry at a laundry mat.......do it in your newly renovated 1 bedroom apartment with fantastic amenities: AC, parking, stacked laundry in unit, stainless steel appliances, quartz counter-tops, NO carpet but vinyl wood planks and stylish 12x24" tile, LED lighting, water saving fixtures. Property is located at the end of a cul-de-sac so relatively quiet and peaceful location. 6 total apartments in the community. Close to all in La Mesa and San Diego.
Drive by property location at 5045 Woodyard Ave, La Mesa.  Nice private cul de sac location.
