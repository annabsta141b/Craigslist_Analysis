Lands End Vacation Rentals is half apartments and half vacation rentals. This listing is for a smaller one bedroom long-term unfurnished apartment. At Lands End, you will fall asleep to the sounds of the ocean and only be steps away from the sand. 
Oceanfront property. Ground level unfurnished one bedroom apartment. Partial Ocean view from the front door. You are just steps away from the ocean! It's rare any of our apartments become available, let alone one with ocean views!
Plenty of ocean sounds and breeze! You are also just footsteps away from the beach. 
Move in ready!
WHERE: Apartment #19 at 308 South The Strand in Oceanside. Small Unit, Approx 300 sq ft.

Along with your apartment, you get full access to the community. Huge community patio in the front with a BBQ. On-site coin-op laundry facility. Best of all your front yard is THE BEACH!
*PLEASE NOTE* This is a smaller one bedroom unit. The bedroom is smaller than usual, some tenants have used this unit as a studio, making the bedroom an office or large closet. This unit is also the only unit on-site that has a side storage yeard. You can easily use this area for a bike or surfboard. 
Must be willing to live in a smaller apartment, living next to the ocean is amazing.
