Renters BEWARE of AD for Escondido FURNISHED ROOM for rent discount for yard/house work   ! 
Onsite Landlords is malicious and treats you unprofessionally. This house is a revolving door. Workers subjected to unfair working conditions and limited personal space. tenants/workers are expected to work more then advertised and any "additional payment" offered by landlord/ husband for side work rarely actually paid to workers. Landlord DOES NOT give deposit back despite house & room already being dirty. Constant yelling and Kitchen always surrounded by flies and animals. 1 Laundry machine for 4-5 other residents ( its never available)  HOUSE has poor living conditions and should be listed as not habitable
