We have a 2br/1bath apartment on our property available for rent in the next couple of weeks. It comes with 1 big parking spot or if you have good parking skills like our current tenants, you can fit two cars. We are 2.5 blocks from the bay and 8-10 blocks from the beach. There is a common area for the tenants to use and we have an orange tree and lemon tree for everyone to use.
