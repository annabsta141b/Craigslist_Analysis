Tired of living in a cookie cutter apt w/ a kitchen that's seen better days? Enjoy urban living? If so check out this immaculate second floor studio studio with onsite coin-op laundry! The apartment building is located in a walkable vibrant urban neighborhood just a few blocks away from from Balboa Park and downtown.
The rent, is $1400 per month. 
Basic rental terms are: no pets, an initial six month lease which then reverts to a month to month. The security cleaning deposit for non-smokers is the same as the rent and there is a $20 credit check fee to process the rental application form (Score: 680 or above).
So if you appreciate a quality place to call "home" and think the rental terms are reasonable, schedule a walkthur inspection.show contact info
