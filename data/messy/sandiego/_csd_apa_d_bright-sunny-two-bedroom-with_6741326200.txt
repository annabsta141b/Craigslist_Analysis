La Jolla Canyon is situated in the heart of the Golden Triangle/UTC. Near both the I-5 and I-805 freeways and just minutes from UCSD & La Jolla's finest beaches.

For convenience in this fast paced urban location, the fitness center & laundry room are open 24 hours. Lush landscaping provides shady trees, flowering shrubs and an inviting pool & spa area. 

The community is laced along a canyon that is rustic, peaceful and home to a variety of plants and wildlife. The canyon also features spectacular views and a scenic nature trail for walking, jogging, or bike riding. Have a relaxing picnic at one of the BBQ areas by the pool or next to the canyon. All this while remaining one of UTCs most budget balanced choices.
