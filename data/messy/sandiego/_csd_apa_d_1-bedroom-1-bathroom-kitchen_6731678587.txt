Hello everyone! I have a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment with living room and kitchen, open for rent and available now! Located just a short walk from University Avenue, balboa park and downtown San Diego! The appliances in the room are brand new and ready just for you! 
We do accept pets with an extra deposit upon move in.
Laundry is also on site, with off street designated parking.
We have more than one room available, the other is a bit bigger as well. So you may choose your room suited to exactly what you need.
Please email for more details and to set up a date to come and see your new apartment! I will respond as soon as possible, thank you!
