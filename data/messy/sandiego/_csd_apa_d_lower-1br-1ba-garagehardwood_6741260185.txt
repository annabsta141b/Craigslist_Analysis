This is an adorable cottage-like apartment, in the beautiful La Playa area of Point Loma. This unit has hardwood floors, a ceiling fan in the bedroom, faux wood blinds, and fresh paint. And with the one car garage you'll never have to worry about parking! On-site laundry.
Great location! Just a short walk to Kellogg's beach and only minutes to Liberty Station, San Diego International airport, downtown, and the Point Loma submarine base. 
Sorry, NO PETS, and we are proud to be a NO SMOKING property.
