Casa Carlotta Apartments are located in Hillcrest, and is within walking distance of Balboa Park, the San Diego Zoo and Downtown Hillcrest. We are also just minutes away from Downtown San Diego. This is not a party complex and we have a firm quiet policy our tenants appreciate. However, we are a very friendly complex with a wonderful sense of community.
Casa Carlotta has easy access to the 163 Freeway, the 8 Freeway and several others off the 8. There are convenient bus stops located just a half block from our gates.
