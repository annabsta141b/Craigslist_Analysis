Block C is the newest addition to the rapidly growing North City master plan development and is the place you will want to live, work and play! Not only is North City the future downtown of North County but it is one of San Diego's "Next Hot Neighborhoods" according to SD Magazine.   Take a dip in Block C's gorgeous pool, stroll through our pet-friendly paseo, wash up the pup in our pet grooming station or spend a day on our sun deck all right here in North County. Conveniently located within the Block C community is Grit Coffee and Prep Kitchen, where you can sip on coffee day or night and grab delicious seasonal comfort food. Steps away is Urge Gastro Pub, a 21,000 square foot restaurant, bar, and brewery with an 8 lane bowling alley. Beyond North City you can even visit the famous Restaurant Row of San Marcos just minutes away off San Marcos Boulevard!  So, if you're looking for a home close to California State University, San Marcos or want to experience the perks of a wonderful apartment home in a convenient location, Block C is the place for you.
