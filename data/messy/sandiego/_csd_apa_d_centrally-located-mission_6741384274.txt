$1300 studio unit 1-Year minimum lease. Located at the foot of Mission Hills this unit is in the heart of everything. Located directly behind nationally acclaimed Lucha Libre Fine Mexican Restaurant, Blonde Bar, & Palomar Market. The unit has been completely remodeled with new paint, wood floors, blinds, ceiling fans, etc. This location isn't for just anyone. You have to realize that you're located directly adjacent to a restaurant, bar, and liquor store. So not only do you get to enjoy the smell of some of the finest Mexican food San Diego has to offer, but you also have to deal with some noise from the commercial locations as well (music, PA system, patrons). Included in the rent is ONE reserved parking spot, trash, and water. We try to encourage tenants who work evening shifts to apply so it doesn't tend to interfere with their sleep because the restaurant and bar are open late on weekends. Past tenants have worked in travel & tourism, entertainment, and restaurant/bars. So, if you can handle the added benefits please don't hesitate to contact Peter  show contact info
 to schedule a viewing of this unit. MUST have a minimum 720 TU score.
****THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT SO READ IT CAREFULLY. IF YOU RENT THE UNIT AND YOU FIND THAT THE NOISE IS TOO MUCH THAT ISN'T AN EXCUSE TO END YOUR LEASE. YOU'RE BEING WARNED IN ADVANCE THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL THE LEVEL OF NOISE THAT COMES FROM THE RESTUARANT/BAR DURING THEIR LISTED BUSINESS HOURS. YOU WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FULL TERM OF YOUR LEASE NO MATTER WHAT.****
