This is a fully furnished 2 bed/2 bath house. It is an addition to the original home buit in 1922. There is only one shared wall with the front duplex. Both bedrooms are upstairs. One full bath downstairs and the second full bath is upstairs. There is a private fenced yard with four person hottub Jacuzzi.
The home is located in the North Park/University Heights area. It is one block north of the wonderful Adams Avenue, and about 1 mile from the heart of North Park & Normal Heights.
There is also a private yard with a hybrid parking spot. Just enter through the pedestrian gate, slide the vehicle gate open and park inside. If you do not wish to use the spot or if you have more than one car, there is plenty of street parking immediately across from the duplex. Very rarely is parking an issue.
100% solar powered home!
The master bedroom has a king size bed, while the second bedroom has a queen size bed.
There is a complimentary laundry room with full size washer and dryer located on the porch next to the entrance of the home. It is stocked with laundry detergent and fabric softener for your use.
