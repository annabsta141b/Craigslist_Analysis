Hello, my name is Austin and I currently have a contract for an apartment in the AVA cortez hill student housing that I will no longer be staying at. The rent is $845 a month, and if you are interested give me a call. The apartments are very nice, and you will be sharing a room with another roommate. The apartments them self have a nice workout room, pool, hot tub, and hangout spots. Perfect for any student planning on attending newschool of architecture or any school in the downtown/sandiego area. Gimme a call with questions or if you're interested in taking it.
