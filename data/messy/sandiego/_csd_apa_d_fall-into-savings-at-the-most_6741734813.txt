Broadstone Little Italy1980 Kettner BlvdSan Diego, CA 92101  Url: http://www.broadstonelittleitaly.com/t/ad?ref=7c2e6eb5a79138aba94e4c71c6e7d34eInspired by the sun, sea and breezes of the Italian Rivera, our amenity collection is centered around a sparkling open-air pool and sundeck that overlooks the bay. Panoramic views filled with sails and sunsets. Chaise lounges and cabanas. Sandals and wayfarers. A zero-edge pool and signature (to be endlessly tweeted) glass-walled spa. All free-flowing from the lush courtyards to the fireside retreat to the indoor-outdoor lounge.And that's just one experience. The rest of the collection features everything from a modern fitness club that will have you cancelling your gym membership, to a professional golf simulator where you can play 18-holes with your foursome, to a clubhouse with a pool table and three large screens for game day.Community AmenitiesZero-Edge Pool with Underwater Speakers and Custom Built Spa with Dramatic Acrylic Water Wall Overlooking the Bay • High-Definition Golf Simulator including Five Championship Golf Courses, Advanced Tracking and Trajectory Analysis • Fitness Club Equipped with State-of-the-Art Technogym Cardio and Weight Training Equipment • Private Yoga and Dance Studio • Intimate Outdoor Dining Area and Work Station with USB, Electrical Outlets and BBQ Grill • Custom Cabanas Surrounding a Fireside Retreat • Resident Clubhouse with Entertaining Kitchen, Pool Table and Three TV's • Fully Equipped Business Center including Mac and PC Options with Professional Printer • Conference Room Accommodating Eight Guests • Pet-Friendly Walkway • Certified Green Point Rated Homes - Proof That Your Home Is Superior and Sustainable • Electrical Car Charging Stations • Complimentary WiFi, MP3 Docking Stations and USB Electrical Outlets Conveniently Located in Amenity Areas • Secluded Water Fountain with a Surprising Element You Don't Want to MissApartment AmenitiesPanoramic Views of San Diego Bay* • Spacious Floor Plans including Multi-level Lofts • Gourmet Kitchens featuring Two Designer Color Schemes • European Style Cabinets and Upgraded Fixtures • Gourmet Kitchens with Quartz or Granite Counters and Full-Height Decorative Tile Backsplash • Frigidaire Gallery Stainless Steel Appliances with Five-Burner Gas Range • Premium Built-In Water Filtration System • Soaring 9'-22' Ceilings • Under-Counter Wine Fridge with Dual Temp Control for Red or White Wines* • MP3 Programmable Doorbells • Frigidaire Affinity Full-Size, Front-Loading Washer and Gas Dryer • Large Walk-in Closets • USB Charging Stations • Designer Marble Bathroom Countertops with Porcelanosa Spanish Tile Flooring • Soaking Tubs or Glass Enclosed Showers • Wood Plank Style Flooring • Smartbox Technology for All Wiring • Dual Sink Vanities* • Personal Patios and Balconies*Mon-Fri: 9AM-6PMSat - Sun: 10AM-5PMWe Love Pets!
