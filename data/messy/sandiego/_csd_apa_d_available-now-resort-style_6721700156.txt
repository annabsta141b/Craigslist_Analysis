Description
  
    Discover resort-style living just minutes from Downtown La Mesa. This freshly remodeled one bedroom is designed to relax and refresh. The perfect space where you can study, work, or retreat to after a long day. Wind down on your private patio with a glass of sangria, then head inside for a movie and popcorn with close friends. If you're craving some calming nature without leaving the buzz of the city behind, you're in the right place. 
When you live at Fleetwood, La Mesa aka "The Jewel of the Hills" is at your feet. From sparkling Lake Murray to the best weekly farmers market in San Diego, you'll never be without weekend plans. You'll be steps away from natural beauty and still just 9 miles east of Downtown San Diego. 
Just minutes away from SDSU and Grossmont colleges, as well as elementary and high schools. Swing by Costco (right down the street) or drop by the Grossmont Center. Conveniently located off the I-8 near the I-5, 805, and 15 highway.
