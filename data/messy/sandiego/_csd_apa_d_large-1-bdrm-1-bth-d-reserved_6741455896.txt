Whether you spend your free time enjoying the sea air from your private patio or balcony or preparing fresh seafood in your gourmet kitchen, the studio, 1 and 2 bedroom apartments at Domain offer premier San Diego living. Ranging from 598 to 1,309 square feet--and with loft-style options with vaulted ceilings--the models at Domain blend modern, open spaces with luxe features and finishes designed to suit you.
