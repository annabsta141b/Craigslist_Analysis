We had to move from this location for jobs across the country and are working with the property management company to get this filled ASAP. This is a very large space for the price with great vaulted ceilings. Neighbors are all very friendly is located at the end of a private dead end street. 
This spot is perfect for a family or young professionals/college students. Very easy to hop on the 8 or head to Ocean Beach/Sunset Cliffs and not far from Pacific Beach. Located near a nice local grocery store and many food options.
