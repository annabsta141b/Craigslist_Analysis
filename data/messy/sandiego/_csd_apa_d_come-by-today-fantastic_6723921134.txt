Welcome home to Verse
This is a Studio, 1 Bath, approximately 510 Sq. Ft. 
At Verse, "luxury" is more than a word, it's a way of life. Our studio, one and two bedroom apartments for rent in Linda Vista, CA, feature the ideal blend of modern convenience and comfortable amenities. You will appreciate our spacious floor plans and contemporary apartment features.
Our community has been designed to appeal to a wide audience. Foodies will love our gourmet, galley-style kitchens, while the creative-types will appreciate ample open wall space and use of mixed textiles in design. Perhaps what appeals to you isn't a space so much as it is an atmosphere. Our apartments are a relaxing escape from the noise of the city outside. At Verse, we provide the space, but you bring it to life.
*Floor plan square footages are approximate and vary by unit type and location.
