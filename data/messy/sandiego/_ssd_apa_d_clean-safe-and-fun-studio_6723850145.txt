This is an excellent opportunity to rent a fully furnished Studio unit in Tijuana. We have a total of 23 units in our East Tijuana development, and almost all of the tenants are Americans, so there is really a nice sense of community here. The property is easily accessed from either the Otay or San Ysidro borders in less than 20 minutes. We are only 25 minutes away from Rosarito Beach. Each unit has a parking stall directly in front of the unit, and the entire property has security fencing which makes it very private.

It is very easy to rent with us, no background check needed. Our monthly rental rate for our studios is $375. We ask for a one month security deposit as well.
