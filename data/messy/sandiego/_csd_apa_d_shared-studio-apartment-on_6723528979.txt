Shared studio apartment on SDSU campus, individual lease agreement, $767/month 
Available in December or January for SECOND SEMESTER rental
Located on SDSU campus, you'll share this studio apartment with one grad student roommate, but you'll sign your own INDIVIDUAL LEASE with Suites on Paseo. The lease will be through July (or longer if you choose). 
This Suites on Paseo is very safe with multiple security guards and it gets great reviews online. It's close to Trader Joe's and the trolley/bus station and a 4 minute walk to the library. The onsite bistro offers monthly meal plans or pay as you go for meals. You can pay extra for secure, onsite parking. Community events such as free yoga classes, movie night, and themed game nights help people get to know each other. You even get weekly HOUSEKEEPING SERVICES as part of your rent! 
Pay $767.00 monthly. This rate include renter's insurance, utilities, furniture, cable, high-speed internet and housekeeping. It's a great deal and I wouldn't be moving out if I wasn't going to a new school!
