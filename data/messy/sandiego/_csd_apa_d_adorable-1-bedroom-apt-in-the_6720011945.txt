Lovely small 1 bedroom with its own stoop in a courtyard. It has its own front and back door. The living room, hallway and bedroom have gorgeous hardwood floors. The kitchen is large enough to hold a dining table. Everything is freshly painted and looks great. NO PETS, SMOKERS or CREDIT BELOW 680. This is a small one bedroom appropriate for single person or couple. No roommates. We are seeking responsible, clean, respectful tenants who always act neighborly, pay on time and will take good care of the new hardwood floors. You pay your own gas, electric and water. The water is $35 a month. There is also a garage available for an additional 150. Please don't disturb current tenants but feel free to drive by to get a feel for the area.
