I am looking to move back to the east coast and have someone rent my 1/1. There are no other 1/1's available at this timeframe and I would assist with moving costs. This would be starting a new lease with Pinnacle and I would close out my lease. I am on the 14th floor and have an AMAZING view. I would be open to have someone move in from October 20-November 30th- I am flexible. You will have to apply via the building and start a new lease (as stated). They are running tons of specials and 1 or 2 months free. 
The reason why I am leaving is because I lost my job here and I moved here from Atlanta in the last 6 months and would like to move back home. I have kept the apartment in great shape and it will be professionally cleaned upon move out.  
Wonderful pool and gym! 
I can show you the apartment almost anytime. Please email me with your first name and Pinnacle in the subject line, so I know it isn't spam. I am a little weary of Craigslist. Thank you so much, Holly
