Come check out our beautiful 2 bed, 2 bath in the most happening spot in San Diego...Downtown! Our 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment #612 just came available at $3295 with an immediate move in. This 1047' sq. apartment is on the 6th floor (top floor) and has washer/dryer in unit, central AC and Heating w/Nest Thermostats and 1 free, assigned parking spot in our underground lot (2 paid lots are a block away if additional parking is needed).

In addition, move in by Oct. 18th and you'll receive a complimentary 1 year membership to San Diego's hippest gym, and our next door neighbor, FIT or a $1000 Visa Gift Card. 
With all the new construction downtown it can get a little overwhelming deciding where to move! Luckily, Urbana is here for you! Built in 2015 Urbana has all the benefits of a brand new downtown property but without all the headaches associated with new construction. We're located on 10th street next to Petco Park and close to all the nightlife, restaurants and breweries downtown has to offer! 
We're a very pet friendly community and allow large dogs up to 100 pounds. Our community amenities are extensive and we have the following:
-Rooftop deck with Jacuzzi and views of Petco Park
-Multiple outdoor grills with propane hooked up
-Clubhouse with pool, shuffle board and 3 big screen TV's complete with cable (great for cord-cutters)
-Outdoor courtyard with water fall and lounge chairs (just below your private balcony)
