Coral Reef Apartments are located in Point Loma, and lie between beautiful Mission Bay Park and San Diego Bay. We are also just 5 miles away from Downtown San Diego. This is not a party complex and we have a firm quiet policy our tenants appreciate. However, we are a very friendly complex with a wonderful sense of community.
Coral Reef has easy access to Interstate 8 and several others off the 8.
