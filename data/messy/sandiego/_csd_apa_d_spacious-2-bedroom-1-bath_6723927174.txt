This is not your typical Chula Vista apartment. This is all custom, completely remodeled 2 bedroom apartment! 
We are a small, quiet, gated community with a gorgeous pool located just minutes away from everything that makes Chula Vista special. We are walking distance to the heart of downtown Chula Vista and its unique atmosphere. Shopping dining and entertainment are all a short distance away. Every school level elementary, middle and high school are less than 1.5 miles away. We are close to the 5 freeway and have easy access to public transportation. Downtown San Diego and the 32nd Street naval base are just a short 15-minute drive on the 5 freeway.
