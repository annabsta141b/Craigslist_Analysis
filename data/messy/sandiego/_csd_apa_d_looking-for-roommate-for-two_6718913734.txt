Hey! I'm looking for a roommate for my two bed, one bath apartment in PB. My current roommate is moving out the beginning of November. 
The room opening up is the master so the room is a little larger (you'll pay $50 more in rent) Rent is $960 for the master + utilities (which is usually $30 for internet and $10-15 for SDGE). 
The location is great, two blocks from the beach, one block from Ralph's and close to all the bars and coffee shops! 
I'm looking for someone who is dog friendly, I have a 1yr old pup. She is super friendly!
I like to take advantage of living so close to the bars and beach so it's not rare to have friends over but I'm respectful of my roommate. I'm looking for someone similar! 
A little about me:
I like to stay active, mostly golfing! I work in the bar business in pb. 420 friendly. Love live music!
Shoot me an email if you think you would be a good fit and let me know a bit about yourself! I'm looking for someone already in the SD area so we can meet prior to singing the lease.  Either M/F, preferably 23-30 years old.
