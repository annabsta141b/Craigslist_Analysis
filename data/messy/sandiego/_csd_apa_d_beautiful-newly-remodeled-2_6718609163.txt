This 2bed/2bath is currently being completely remodeled and will be ready to move-in in September. It will be absolutely stunning once the remodel is finished and you couldn't ask for a better location! You can set up an appointment to see the unit before it is finished so you have a good idea what it will look like when it is all done. The pictures included are not of the actual unit but one that is similar to what this unit will look like when complete.
Amazing North Park location!! Walk score of 95! Just about anything you could want is within walking distance: breweries, coffee shops, restaurants, boutique shops, music venues and a Target is currently being built nearby. This location is very close to major freeways so driving is a breeze as well.
