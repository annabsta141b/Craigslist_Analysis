    Community Description:
        There aren't many places where so many elements come together to make a place so inviting, charming and full of life.  And you'd be right.  Only this time, you haven't been whisked away to some quaint, hillside village in the Italian countryside.  As wonderful as it is to escape to this special little corner of the world, relish in the luxury of knowing that so much lies waiting just minutes away.  A leisurely walk finds you at Fenton Marketplace with myriad of shops and restaurants for every taste.  A little farther, and you're in the shopping meccas of Fashion Valley and Mission Valley Center, or maybe it's just stretching out for a more relaxed afternoon on San Diego's best beaches.  Whatever it is, you're once again certain of something- such is the life you've always desired.  Such is life.  You've just come home. To Portofino.
