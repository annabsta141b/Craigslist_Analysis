Stop throwing your money away Renting! Buy and get a set in mortgage that will never rise again for the same amount or less then renting!! Get rid of that landlord for life and you will not be at the mercy of that 30-day notice. Don't forget the huge tax advantages with money back every year and the equity you will be building each month as you pay. When you buy you get a bundle of rights as a homeowner and you get out of that temporary living situation. Isn't it time you got a place you can call home!!!! Call Alex your local "Keller Williams Realtor" today to find out your options. I can and will get you a great deal!!!
