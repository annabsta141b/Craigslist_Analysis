VICI is the perfect place to call home and centrally located in the heart of Little Italy. Our recently constructed Piazza Della Famiglia is at your doorstep offering a 10,00 sq ft European-style piazza; this is where the Little Italy farmers market takes place every Saturday morning. The piazza also hosts 2 restaurants (Morning glory + Farmers Table,) a cafe(Frost me), and a very special food hall. We are walking distance to over 50 restaurants, 30 breweries and bars, 15 cafes, and 2 entertainment venues. How awesome is that for a place to call home?
