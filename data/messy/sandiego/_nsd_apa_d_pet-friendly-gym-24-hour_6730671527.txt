The Dylan Apartment Homes is located just off the 76 highway between Carlsbad and Vista, conveniently located 5 miles away from the ocean and 2 miles away from Camp Pendleton. This beautiful community is richly landscaped with an unusual blend of tall pines, redwoods, gardens, and grassy green areas. The one bedroom, two bedroom, and three bedroom floor plans feature some of the most peaceful living spaces in Oceanside, California. Residents are invited to sit back and relax by one of our two sparkling swimming pools. The Dylan Apartment Homes is a pet friendly community, welcoming both cats and dogs with only a few breed restrictions.
