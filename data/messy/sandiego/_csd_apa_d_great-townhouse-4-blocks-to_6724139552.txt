Really neat townhouse in quiet location just four blocks from Windansea Beach. Extra large en-suite bedrooms with large walk-in closets. Newer appliances and granite counters. Hardwood floors downstairs. Bedrooms are carpeted & adjacent bathrooms have tiled floors. Both bedrooms have balconies. Generous cabinet & storage space. Neutral decor. Nice sunny patio. Quiet yet near the schools. Tandem parking with one carport space & one tandem space.
A small dog would be considered with increased deposit. Sorry No Smokers, common laundry room for just four units.
