New floors, new kitchen and bathroom cabinets/counters, new appliances, new double-pane windows, new bathtub with tiled shower, new toilets, new flooring, new paint, new electrical, everything in this apartment is new.  Both bedrooms are good size (12ft x 12ft) and master bedroom has walk in closet and its own half bath.  Unit is downstairs and comes with 2 parking spaces.  Building has onsite washer and dryer for exclusive use of the tenants.  Owner pays water and garbage and you pay for gas and electricity.  We are looking for responsible tenants who will take care of the apartment.  No pets.  Minimum 1 year lease and $1525 security deposit.  Feel free to drive by and see the building from the outside and email if you have more questions or would like set up a viewing.
