Currently looking to rent my 2nd bedroom out for 9 months. Apartment is fully furnished besides the 2nd bedroom. Our apartment is in walking distance from stores and bars. Also, close entrance to the 5 and 56. Laundry, air conditioning and dishwasher in apartment. Parking space is an extra cost. I have a small dog so must love animals!
