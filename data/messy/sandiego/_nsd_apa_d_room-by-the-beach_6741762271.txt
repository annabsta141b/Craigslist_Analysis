We have a 3 bedroom apartment with all the bedrooms on the second floor.  There is a shared a bathroom but there are 2.5 (1 private) in the whole place.  We have 2 assigned spots and plenty of street parking.  There is a washer and dryer in the unit and we have a gas stove, dishwasher and microwave.  The place is available now
We are two 30-year old active guys, who attend concerts and enjoy a good time.  One of us works from home and other works at a manufacturing company in San Marcos.  We keep our apartment fairly clean and are generally easy to get along with.  We are looking for someone similar and this applicant may have to sign a lease for a year.  We are currently on month to month.  There will be an application process with a fee of $25.
