	Our Cypress floor plan is our large, 693 square ft one bed one bath apartment home. All of our apartment homes are newly renovated in the kitchen and bathroom area and also have their own washer and dryer inside a walk-in pantry in the kitchen!

We are only 10 minutes walks to downtown Sunnyvale, either for a night out for nice dinner or a stroll to a Farmer Market on the weekend. It is also the same distance to Sunnyvale CalTrain station, if you want to visit San Francisco for sightseeing and don't want to deal with the traffics! 
	The lushly landscaped Briarwood Apartments in Sunnyvale, CA lets you live closer to nature while still in the heart of the Silicon Valley. Your commute's a snap with easy access to major highways, Cal Train, and the Sunnyvale Town Center. Our newly renovated homes feature open kitchen layouts, new appliances, cabinets and counter tops as well as walk-in closets, in-home washer/dryer and private patio/balcony with storage. Unwinding from the work week is a breeze  hangout by the pool, take the kids to the playground and wrap it all up with a casual get-together in the picnic area.
