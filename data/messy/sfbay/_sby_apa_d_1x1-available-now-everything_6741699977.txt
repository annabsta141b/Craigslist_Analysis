	Vista 99 is nestled in the heart of Silicon Valley, within the Renaissance area of North San Jose. This tech-focused hub is booming, as more fast-growing companies flock to the area and more professionals follow their lead, but it's great for more than just work! The city is home to one of three remaining Japantowns in the country, and the abundant culture in all corners of the city make living here a colorful and educational experience. North San Jose offers walkability to area restaurants, parks, nightlife and the new Levi's Stadium, which makes this gem of Silicon Valley perfect for the person who needs to be close to work, but far enough away to enjoy life outside the office. Come see what our tech-savvy home has to offer!
