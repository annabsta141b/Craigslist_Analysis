Four bedroom, 2 bathroom chalet in South Lake Tahoe available this winter. This is a true "Tahoe style cabin" with knotty pine wainscoting, wood beamed ceilings, original brick fireplace, and brand new 6- person hot tub overlooking a large, pretty yard with scattered pine trees. About half the house is recently remodeled and updated and all-around it's just a lovely, warm, cozy winter home. This is a 4 bedroom / 2 bathroom house on 2 levels, with parking for 3 or 4 cars, in a charming neighborhood that is a 5 minute walk to the Lake, and the same distance to every kind of store, cafe, restaurant, bank- you name it- that you could need. It is also about 2 minutes' drive to Heavenly, and the same to the casinos if that's what floats your boat! Upcoming holidays available! (holiday rates apply of $400/ night for Thanksgiving/ Christmas/ New Years and Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day- and taxes and cleaning- ask about discounted cleaning fee- for next year). Dogs are welcome, and there is an amazing park about 2 minutes walk from the house to let the dogs loose, walking through a large meadow while looking straight on at the mountains. I can even give you dog walking services information if that's of use or need. 22 pics available on request, and I can tell you more about pricing at that time, too. You pay utilities and snowplow fee. Hoping to find a group for January through April.
thank you!
