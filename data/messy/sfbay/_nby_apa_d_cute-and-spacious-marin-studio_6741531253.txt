Available studio 12/01/18. I have been in the place for 16 months and have thoroughly enjoyed my time there. It is a unit built into a beautiful Marin home. Its completely private from the house. All amenities are only yours. 
Unit includes washer and dryer, kitchen with brand new appliances, walk-in closet, full bathroom, and street parking. I have never had an issue with the place. Definitely a great deal. 
Place can be furnished for the first 6 months (till 06/01/19). I will be in a furnished apartment in the city and do not need my items till then. I have a bed, TV/ entertainment center, all kitchen dishes etc. 
Landlords live in the house. Very nice people. Message me to come see the place. They would like a person to rent for a year.
