STEPS FROM GREAT SHOPPING, DINING, AND LIVING
Maxwell apartments deliver a turnkey lifestyle with everything you need within walking distance, and so much more just a short BART ride or drive away. A variety of fine dining options, countless concert venues, and social lounges are steps from your front door. Maxwell Apartments near BART are also in close proximity to the Jack London Square, and a quick 15 minutes BART ride puts you directly in San Francisco.
From Maxwell, you can walk to the shops, bars, and restaurants of Uptown Oakland. The Old Oakland Farmers Market is a local favorite that is regarded as one of the best farmer's markets in the area. High end shopping at Bay Street is a drive just minutes away as well.
Maxwell is also adjacent to the 19th Street BART station for quick and easy access to the Oracle Arena, or San Francisco. Our location also offers light speed access to Interstate 980, 880, 580, and 80.
