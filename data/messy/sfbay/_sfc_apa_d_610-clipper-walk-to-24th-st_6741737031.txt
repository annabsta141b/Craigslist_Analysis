Noe Valley is an inviting cocktail of cosmopolitan and cozy. The area's microclimate and vibe are a few degrees warmer than the citywide average. Flock to the Farmer's Market for organic produce and crunchy granola good times, soak in the communal atmosphere at the Caskhouse, take your bestie for a heart-to-heart over high-tea at Lovejoys. Noe Valley's sunny atmosphere makes residents glow with pride.
