	Spectacular apartment home. This large floor plan is perfect for families with its dining room separated from the living room it gives it that house warming feeling. These include in apartment washer/dryers, all the kitchen space you need to cook up a feast, jacuzzi is big enough to be a mini swimming pool, dog friendly access areas, and walk in closets!
	Our awesome location is next to Costco, Trader Joe's and walking distance to the South San Francisco BART station. We are super convenient to the city with just a 25 minute BART ride into town, or hop onto 280 or 101 to get anywhere in the Bay!
