Gorgeous 1102 sq ft 2 Bed, 2 Bath apartment in the heart of Japantown, San Jose for rent. A lease of this duration (Dec 2018 - Mid April 2019) is NOT available directly via the leasing office (minimum 12 months). I am looking for new tenants to take over my lease due to other commitments which requires me to move. Would otherwise have liked to stay in this apartment complex for as long as possible. 
Deposit: One Month Rent (Negotiable) 
Rent: $3,600 (Negotiable)
