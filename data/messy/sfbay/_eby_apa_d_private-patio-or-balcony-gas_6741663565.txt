Park Sierra at Iron Horse Trail Apartments in Dublin brings with it some history from the late 1800's. The property was developed on the route of the Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way established in 1891 and abandoned in 1977. The route has now rebirthed as the 33 mile multi-use, Iron Horse Recreation Trail.
The history of this period was also captured in the interior of the property which is well-designed and beautifully decorated in a "Sundance" motif. Enjoy an Old West feel with the modern conveniences of today. When you drive through the gates of this Dublin apartment community, you'll have access to all the finest amenities. Meet your neighbors at a Super Bowl party in the Resident Lounge or head over to the fitness center for a quick work out. BBQ some burgers with the kids out at the pool or take a dip in the pool - whatever your fancy, you'll find it here at Park Sierra Apartments.
And all this just minutes from the Dublin BART station and 580 and 680 freeways. Park Sierra Apartments features unique "carriage" style floor plans with private front patio entries, free enclosed garages, designer paint and lighting and so much more!
