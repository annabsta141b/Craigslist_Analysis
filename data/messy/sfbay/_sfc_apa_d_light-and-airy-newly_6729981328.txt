Nestled on a quiet block in the heart of the Inner Richmond District, is a charming, furnished 2 bedroom property, just a stone's throw from a prime shopping district and a wide selection of express mass transit routes.     This spacious and newly remodeled, furnished 2 bedroom property combines a terrific set of attributes which make a great option for those who need short to mid-term furnished housing in the North Western quadrant of San Francisco. The home exudes a decidedly light and airy ambiance, due to its open concept floor plan, and its abundance of natural light, which is accentuated by the home's massive bay windows. The home also benefits from a Southern Exposure, which adds to the home's abundant natural light.  The home's chef's kitchen and dining area provide ample space for cooking and dining. The newly refurbished bathroom provides a warm and luxurious environment, which add to the home's overall charm. In addition to the home's wonderful interior spaces, it is also tremendously convenient, due to its proximity to transit routes and the vast majority of San Francisco's health care facilities. Steps from the home are the bustling shops and restaurants of Clement Street and Geary Boulevard, meaning that one can fulfill all of his or her shopping and dining needs all within walking distance, taking full advantage of the quintesential, highly walkable, San Francisco lifestyle.
