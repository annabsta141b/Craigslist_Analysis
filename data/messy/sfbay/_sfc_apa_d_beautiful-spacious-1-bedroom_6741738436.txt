Hello,
We have a large, spacious one bedroom available in our centrally located beautiful house beginning on 12/1.  The room is roughly 15' X 10' and features a Victorian chandelier with plenty of room for a queen/king bed, TV, wardrobe, desk, drawers, and bookshelves.  Our house has a back porch/patio, washer/dryer in unit, a massive kitchen with gas stoves and modern appliances, a large living room, and access to a garage for additional storage.  It is conveniently located near the intersection of Post and Gough, within walking distance to Japantown (5 min), Polk Street (8 min), Filmore Street (10 min), Whole Foods (12 min), 24 Hr Fitness (7 mins), Walgreens (4 min), Lafayette Park (8 mins), and public transportation (bus stop 30 secs from front door).  We are also 12 mins away from Hamilton Rec Center, which features free-to-use tennis courts, indoor/outdoor basketball courts, weight room, and pool.  
Your new roommates are aged 24 - 30 who went to UPenn and Northwestern.  All are fun young professionals (one data scientist, one lawyer, one management consultant) who work hard and play hard.  
Ideally would love a full-time roommate, but we want the right individual so we're requesting an initial sublet with the opportunity to evolve into full-time.   Please get in touch so we can show you our beautiful home!
