As you can see, this unit has just been beautifully remodelled. Everything is brand new including a new and efficient natural gas furnace.
It's a very short walk to grocery store, shops, coffee, and restaurants.
The unit has a large walk-in closet, a sliding door closet, and an entry way closet.
Water, hot water, garbage, and cable are included in the rent.
Unit has one reserved covered parking spot and other open parking. Complex has a pool, sauna, and nice grounds. The unit is easily and quickly accessed from the parking spot.
Send me a note with any questions or if you want to take a look at the place. We require a one-year lease.
Thanks
