	Fabulous 1 bedroom apartment with a balcony and view! This apartment includes all the essentials. Stop by to check out our oasis in the center of SoMa! We have a sparkling courtyard with a fire pit for you to enjoy.

	SoMa is one of the most up and coming neighborhoods in SF and stretches from the Mid Market area by Van Ness all the way East to the Embarcadero. It's an eclectic blend of sights, sounds, smells, and has something for every taste. It also changes rapidly; sometimes a block away can be an entirely different world!

Here at SoMa Square, we are located close to Rincon Hill and the Financial District and border 3rd street one of the main arteries of San Francisco. You'll find it convenient to be in the center of it all in a well kept area of SF. The Yerba Buena Gardens, Union Square shopping, wild and eclectic nightlife, soothing bay views of the Embarcadero, and the hustle and bustle of the FiDi are all a short distance away from your front door. 

If you need to get around the Bay, simply hop on BART or unlock a ZipCar and find yourself a mere block away from all major freeway entrances and on ramps. This is truly commuter's and walker's paradise.

You will find that our community is unlike any other in the area with our elevated central courtyard that feels like an oasis in the concrete jungle. You need to stop by on your apartment search and see that value, convenience, and comfort coalesce here at SoMa Square Apartments in San Francisco!
