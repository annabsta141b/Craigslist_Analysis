Single room available in a great 2BR 1BA apartment in the heart of Nob Hill. The apartment is one block from Polk street, walking distance to the Financial District and Market Street, with easy access to public transportation. The room will come unfurnished, but comfortably fits a bed, dresser, and has a large closet. The apartment has a kitchen and living room that are fully furnished. There is laundry on-site, and a great backyard with plenty of space.
I am moving to a new place, and looking for someone to take my spot for a move-in date of December 1st. The roommate is a friend of mine in his mid-20s, very easy going and clean. Initial lease term is 3 months, but is flexible. Please reply with your name, a little bit about yourself, and a link to social media (Facebook/LinkedIn) if possible, and we can set up a time for you to come by and check out the place. Please let me know in case of questions.
