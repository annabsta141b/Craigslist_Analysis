I am looking for a quiet, respectful, and clean person to sublet my fully furnished studio for the month of December
One person only, no exceptions. 
The price of $1500/month (all inclusive: includes utilities + high speed internet)
Quite, sunny, warm apartment with a gorgeous view in a VERY safe neighborhood. 
•	Laundry in the building
•	2 blocks from UC Berkeley
•	New hardwood floors
•	Central heating
•	Plenty of parking on the street
Wifi + Utilities are paid.
Full kitchen (all to yourself) with all necessary appliances (microwave, coffee maker, toaster, gas stove, fridge, etc.), table, 2 chairs, plates, etc.
Furnished bedroom: Full bed with awesome, super comfortable new mattress, 4 pillows and linen, wardrobe, chest of drawers, large mirror, desk, computer chair, lamps. Walk-in closet with plenty of storage space.
Bathroom: Shared with another super quiet, very respectful & easy-going tenant (international student) who stays in a separate room across the hall.
Looking for someone QUIET, responsible, non-smoker. For one person only. No guests, no parties. Absolutely no pets, sorry.
The place will be best suitable for a graduate student/an associate professor/young professional. International students are welcome!
