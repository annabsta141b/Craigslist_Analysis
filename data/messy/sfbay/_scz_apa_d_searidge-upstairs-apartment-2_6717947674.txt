Charming abode with rich wood accents and light contemporary feel in beach community. Walk to shops, restaurants and the beach from this large upstairs flat wrapped around a private balcony that is accessible from both the kitchen and living room. A generous floorplan (925 SF) lends itself to relaxed living in a cozy upscale building with laundry, covered parking, and separate storage.
