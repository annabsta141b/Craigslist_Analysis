My family and I just moved out (relocation) and, because our landlord is awesome, we want to help him rent out the apartment.
It's an updated 2 bed / 1 bath: Nest thermostat, new appliances, awesome patio and in-unit LG front load washer/dryer.
- 200 yards from a Starbucks, Safeway and a large row of restaurants.
- 200 yards away from East Bay Trail (runs to Walnut Creek, Lafayette, Bart, etc.)
- 100 feet from a Pleasant Oaks Park with baseball/soccer fields and a playground.
- 3 min drive to 680
- 5 min drive to BART (bike in 10 min along dedicated bike paths)
Gated private pool (never overly crowded).  Dedicated covered parking spot with on-site storage bin included.
Pet friendly: big plus for anyone struggling to find a place w/ a pet.  A few people have pets and they're all very respectful, responsible owners.
All-in-all: My family and I loved this place.  We'd take walks w/ our 3-year-old to Safeway and Starbucks.  We'd chill on the patio looking out at Mt. Diablo.  I'd bike with no effort to BART every morning.  It's a great place.
