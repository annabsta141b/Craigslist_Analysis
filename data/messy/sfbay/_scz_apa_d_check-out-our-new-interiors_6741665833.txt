The Hilltop Apartments could be your next home sweet home! 
Our stunning community is located at 363 Western Drive. We are located nearby restaurants, shopping, entertainment and attractions (Wilder Ranch State Park is a gorgeous place to take a nice hike and just minutes down the road), local farmers markets, gorgeous Pacific Ocean beaches, close to the UCSC campus and on the bus line (route 20). 
We are a 168 apartment community situated on 9 acres and feature over 845 trees on site. It truly is a remarkable community and you will see that upon arrival.
Your newly remodeled 2 bedroom apartment home features an expansive layout, fully equipped kitchen featuring brand new stainless steel appliances such as a frost-free refrigerator, dishwasher and microwave, modern fixtures, ceiling fan, quartz counter tops, a built-in closet organizer and faux wood plank flooring.
The apartment is cable/internet ready, but you'd need to provide the service on your own through Comcast Ixfinity. 
Enjoy one of our beach cruiser bikes to enjoy around town and visit the local farmers market, relax by the resort-style heated pool, or read a book while laying on one of our four hammocks. Sit fire side with friends while enjoying the stunning view.
