This is a three bedroom 2 bathroom apartment.  It is the first floor of a three story house.  The 2700 dollar rent includes garbage, electricity and water.  The apartment is spacious, updated and has a lot of storage.  There is no garage access for the apartment but plenty of parking on the road.  We are looking for a non smoker, no pets.  There are stairs to get down to the first floor so if you have difficulty with stairs this is not the place for you.  There is no neighbors around the house and a creek runs through the back yard.
Send us a short bio about who you are and who would be living in the apartment.
