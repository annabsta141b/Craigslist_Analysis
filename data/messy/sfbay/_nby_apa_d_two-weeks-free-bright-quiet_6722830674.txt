Nice apartment in great location.
Two weeks free with 1 year lease.

919 Sonoma Avenue #1
My current tenant has moved out and it is time to find a new neighbor. A great upper unit in a quiet building on Sonoma Avenue. Close to public transportation and downtown. The building is a typical 80's building, but has been extensively remodeled. All units have covered parking, free storage and on-site laundry facilities.  
The apartment is freshly painted and ready with brand new tile, a new bathroom, quartz countertops, and wood floors.  The bedroom is large and features both a linen closet and a full wall of closet space.  The building is a great community of really nice people. The open kitchen is features quartz countertops, has lots of counter and cabinet space, and includes a stove, fridge, and garbage disposal. Wood floors in the living room and bedroom.  There is also a nice deck off of the living room.  
Security Deposit is $1,595. Water, Sewer, and trash billed separately. 
We welcome tenants with cats, but do not allow dogs.  Unfortunately we do not accept Section 8 vouchers.   Please note, our complex is no smoking anywhere inside or out pursuant to Santa Rosa Health and Safety Code.
