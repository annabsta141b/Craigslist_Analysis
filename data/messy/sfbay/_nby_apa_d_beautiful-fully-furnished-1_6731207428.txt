Located in a renovated historic mansion with hardwood floors, you'll have a parking space, large washer/dryer, and outdoor deck and patio to enjoy. There's a spacious walk-in closet as well as brand-new appliances and gas range stove. The living room has a large flat screen television and the apartment is equipped with central heat and air. One bathroom with good shower pressure and plenty of shelving for storage. 
Walk to everything Sonoma has to offer (restaurants, wine tastings, yoga, library, City Hall community park, farmer's market, and events) in just 5 minutes, as well as to CVS and Whole Foods in 7 minutes. You are welcome to entertain outdoors in the partially fenced yard spaces (with plum, loquat, fig, and chestnut trees). Set up your BBQ and if you enjoy plants, feel free to garden away! The apartment is located in the back of the house, so it is private, quiet, and street noise is virtually non existent.
