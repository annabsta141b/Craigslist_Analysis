Neighborhood Description:
A great centrally located neighborhood with easy access to all forms of public transportation. There's been quite a renaissance lately in this area which has resulted in many new and wonderful shops and restaurants such as Pizza Moda. If you like to cook at home, you can shop close by at Trader Joe's, or take a short ride to Berkeley Bowl West. Commuters and students alike will find BART (around) running to San Francisco and back regularly from North Berkeley, Ashby and Downtown stations. For those of you who use ride-sharing services, you should experience reasonable rates to and from the UC Berkeley, your local workplace or neighboring areas with quick pick up times.
