Hi!
I'm moving out of my apartment in the coming weeks (most likely next) and would love for someone to take it over before the end of the month. 
Here are some details:
- 2BR without a common space. The living room is now a private bedroom (with a locking door). 
- Two closets (one would be the coat closet, I just used this as my personal closet)
- One bathroom with a tub
- No laundry onsite, the laundromat is one block away
- Room in the kitchen for a small table
- Large pantry and plenty of closet space
- Storage space next to the refrigerator
- Gated parking space for a motorcycle/scooter/bicycle 
- Access to a roof with beautiful views of Golden Gate bridge and the Bay. I have patio furniture on the roof, which I'll leave
- One mini-mart on each corner of the block
- 10 min walk to Fort Mason
- 4-unit building with quiet, respectful tenants
***The rent could be modified once an inspection is done, but it's likely to stay around the same rate - my rent was increased $25 last year. It's $2,825 at the moment
