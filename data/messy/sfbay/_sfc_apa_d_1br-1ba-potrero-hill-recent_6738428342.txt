Potrero Hill is one of the hottest neighborhoods in San Francisco. With some of the best weather in the city, and it's close proximity to SOMA, The Mission, & Dogpatch, you couldn't ask for a better place to call home. This unit was recently renovated, including refinishing the original hardwood floors, updating the bathroom, and installation of a washer and dryer in the unit. All of the rooms are large, with big windows that let in tons of light. The living room has a functioning fireplace, and 2 picture windows. The kitchen has updated appliances, and a separate dining area that would also make a great office. Another big plus is the abundance of closets, a total of 4 in the apartment. Plenty of free street parking, with no permit required.Must see to appreciate!Kent WilliamsCA BRE #01904611 show contact info
