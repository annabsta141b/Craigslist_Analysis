Come live in a new, spacious 1600+-sq-foot 3-story modern townhome (plus private garage parking), which is located one block from the charming shops on Fillmore Street in Pacific Heights. With a WalkScore of 100, everything you need is at your fingertips in this dynamic upscale neighborhood, including Michelin and James Beard Award winning restaurants including SPQR, State Bird Provision, Progress, Sweet Maple, Out the Door, and Dosa; and high-end designer shopping. Fillmore Street also offers a great farmer's market on Sundays. Easy public transportation downtown or to the Marina, and steps to Alta Plaza Park - the local hillside park with panoramic views of the city and the Bay. 
My home is a three-story town home with 2br/2.5ba/loft, which occupies a private, top-floor corner location in a modern building with an elevator. There is tons of natural light, and is a quiet respite from the buzz of San Francisco.
•	The main floor features a modern kitchen with granite counter-tops, gas-range; new refrigerator; continues into a dining room with vaulted ceilings and skylight; a comfortable living room with a wood-burning fireplace and cable hookups, a convenient half-bath for your guests, and a balcony walk-out deck with city views.
•	On the 3rd level, above the living area, is a sky-lit lofted space. I use this space to play piano, to read books, to work on my laptop (at a standing bookshelf desk), and to ride my road bike on a trainer. The double French doors open onto a private rooftop patio with comfortable outdoor furniture, a grill, gas heater light, a fire pit, flowering succulents/plants and stunning San Francisco city views.
•	Downstairs are the bedrooms - two large bedrooms with ample dressers/closet space with California closet built-in storage and multiple full-length mirrors, and two full bathrooms with tub-showers. The master bedroom has a welcoming, decadent king bed with an ensuite bath. The second bedroom has three large bay windows which capture amazing morning light and a view of the beautiful St. Dominic's Church. 
•	The home has hardwood flooring throughout, white plantation shutters in both bedrooms, and a newly remodeled kitchen.
