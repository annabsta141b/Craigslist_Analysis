Palo Alto Plaza falls in the sought after Los Altos School District and is close to many top corporate employers and shuttles. You also have peace of mind with a controlled access lobby and gated parking. Combined with phenomenal new kitchens, wood floors, and double pane windows, Palo Alto Plaza offers you the latest in contemporary urban living including a co-work space with free Wi-Fi and a package concierge system with 24/7 pickup. Our private park-like interior courtyard with mature trees, greenery, and flowers that surround the spa, resort style pool, and fitness center is a must see. It is difficult to find such a serene spot in an area where you are still able to walk to Caltrain, shops, & cafes. This apartment requires a $500 deposit.
