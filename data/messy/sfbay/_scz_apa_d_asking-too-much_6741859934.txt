It's funny how I see the same posts over and over with the same 3-4 bed homes for 3500-4000 -even 5000 a month. Don't you think if you're able and going to spend that kind of money that you should probably just buy a house at that point. How long are you going to go without getting ANY rent before you finally realize that it is insane that you need to have 10k to move into a basic house here. I don't care how many square feet it is or how nice it is, it's insane. Have fun updating your ads.
