"Brand new Live/Work MacroUnits! Next to uptown Oakland
The unit has 2 rooms and 2 lofts, The rent is only $3,200, 
I am sure you can do the math yourself, but if you split between 4 people it can be on average $800 per person.
Our mission is to save people money and make it easier for people to live in great locations at affordable prices. 
Most people who signed up to our units used our roommates matching service, It is simple:
1. You can either join an existing group on their lease or secure a new unit, and add others to your lease.
2. We will help in finding you roommates and setting up a video chat, if both sides approve, they will be added to your lease.
The live/work space includes 2 full bathrooms, large living area, full kitchen, heating, AC. washer/dryer in building.
We are still finishing the construction until 12/1, so you can enjoy low Pre-leasing prices. 
Come to see the units, Tuesday 6 PM, Thursday 6 PM, Sunday 4 PM (Require booking a meeting first)"
