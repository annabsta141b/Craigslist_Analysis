This is a very small studio different from the apartment that was on craiglist earlier.  This apartment is ideal for someone that does very little cooking since there is no stove.  It does come with an outdoor barbecue outside on the deck which is very nice.  Utilities are separate and laundry is available onsite.  Working on pictures.
