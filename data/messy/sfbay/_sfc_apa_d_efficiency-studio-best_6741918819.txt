I have an efficiency studio for rent in Nob Hill. The studio does not have a kitchen, so it's perfect for someone who does not cook. It has a south facing bedroom, a bathroom with a claw foot tub/ shower, and a refrigerator and microwave. Onsite laundry. We are a block away from Grace Cathedral and Huntington Park. Trader Joe's is four blocks away.
Available from December 1st.
No pets please.
