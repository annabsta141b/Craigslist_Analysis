Cedars Studio Apartments offer spacious units in a serene, tree-lined community that matches the complex's cabin-like fasade. Our studios have open layouts, in which a large closet and separate kitchen area gives the effect of multiple rooms. Providing natural light to an already warm space, some units feature sliding glass doors that lead to a private patio where residents can enjoy long sunny days. The kitchen features modern fixtures - including gas stoves - and a convenient breakfast counter. A gated pool area is provided, among many more amenities, including air conditioning for those warm summer nights. 
Located on Union Avenue, one block West of Bascom Avenue, our complex has easy access to Highways 17, 85 and 280, as well as Campbell's Light Rail Station & minutes from the Heart of Silicon Valley. 
On Bascom Avenue you'll find Starbucks, Whole Foods, and local Banks. With being only a block and a half south of the Pruneyard Shopping Center and a short distance to Downtown Campbell, you are in the center of it all. Restaurants, bars, boutiques, shops, grocery stores and even a movie theater allows our residents to enjoy all that Campbell has to offer - and you don't even have to get in your car!
Visit Downtown Campbell and enjoy your morning coffee at Starbucks or Orchard Valley Coffee shop. Grab a cupcake from Food-Networks Cupcake Wars winner Frost Cupcakes along with a good book from Recycle Bookstore. Stop in the many unique boutiques with many retail shops. 
Enjoy Sushi, pizza, Italian or Greek cuisine at the local restaurants.
Campbell's Farmer Market every Sunday year 'round from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.
