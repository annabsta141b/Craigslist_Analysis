This is a 1 Bedroom, 1 Bath. It is the most popular layout for a one bedroom- Layout A. I am currently renting, but would like to vacate one month prior to my lease expiration. I spoke to management and I can offer a One Month Lease Take over with an option to extend into a lease, or go month to month! Perfect for corporate housing, temporary stays, or a great way to test a brand new building out! The unit will not come furnished.
