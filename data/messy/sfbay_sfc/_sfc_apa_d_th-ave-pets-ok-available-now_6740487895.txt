The Sunset is the best of both worlds - suburban charms with urban amenities. Divided into "Inner" and "Outer," the two neighborhoods share proximity to nature; Ocean Beach and Golden Gate Park are two beacons for fresh-air lovers. For lovers of the indoors, Irving and Taraval boast plenty of excellent spots to eat, drink and be merry.
