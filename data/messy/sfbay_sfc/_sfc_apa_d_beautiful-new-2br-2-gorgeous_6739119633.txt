This spacious new apartment is located in a small building near the Civic Center BART (two blocks), the freeway (101), and Harvest Urban Market (one block). The apartment features numerous designer touches, including Modani Vilano hardwood floors, made of wire brushed, oil finished European oak, and recessed lighting with Lutron Diva dimming. The kitchen features stainless steel appliances, including a dishwasher, and Krion white countertops. Krion is a new generation solid surface material that's warm to the touch, yet feels similar to natural stone. It's a non-porous, anti-bacterial surface that's unaltered by any type of additive. Each of the two elegant bathrooms feature a large shower stall with decorative tiles. The bedrooms feature double-paned windows and an innovative closet storage solution. Last but not least, the apartment has its own gas furnace controlled by a NEST thermostat.
