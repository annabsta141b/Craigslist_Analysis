Enjoy the view from this beautifully furnished 2BR / 1 BA apartment in Richmond San Francisco. Hardwood floors, amazing natural light, lots of windows, big dining/ living room, and large Kitchen. Tons of storage! Also has a small deck outside with a potting shed (more storage). There are outside stairs from the rear of the building with very little street noise. It is surrounded by houses with families so it is quiet overall. Street parking is available and fairly easy to find. Centrally located in SF with close proximity to the 38 Geary, 31 Balboa, and 5 Fulton bus lines. Please note, this apartment is in a wonderful location! Move right in. The home is beautifully furnished just as the picture shows, it has a queen size bed and a sofa bed. 
You will be sharing this apt with me, an USF graduate student in her late 20s. If you are interested, please contact me at:  show contact info
