*** This is a Rent-Controlled Building ***
We have just finished remodeling this top floor studio in this classic 1924 building. Everything in the apartment is new, with a new kitchen and appliances, as well as a brand new bathroom.
We also installed new double pane windows, refinished the hardwood floors, gave it a fresh coat of paint.
Main features:
New bathroom with subway tile on the walls and marble tile on the floor
New kitchen with new stainless steel appliances including a dishwasher, new fridge, gas stove/oven, hood that vents outside, garbage disposal
* Built in wine fridge * 
There is a roof deck with GGB views
Excellent Location! The apartment is located just a few blocks from the Russian Hill Polk Street commercial district, just a few clocks to the fun section of Chestnut Street, and a short walk to Union Street. There is also a bus stop just across the street.
** Please note that a couple photos are of an identical unit below this one.
Please call or text to set up a private showing.
