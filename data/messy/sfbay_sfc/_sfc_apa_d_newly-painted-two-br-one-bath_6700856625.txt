Short walk to USF, Golden Gate Park and Clement Street shops and restaurants.
This sunny 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom unit, with a large living room that can be used as third bedroom, is on the second floor of a well maintained three floor building and was recently vacated by three USF students (students usually use the large living room as a third bedroom so that each roommate will have their own room). The unit has new paint and was re-modeled two years ago with new wall to wall carpets throughout the apartment, new granite counter tops and kitchen area, new electric range, new refrigerator, new stainless steel sink, and new range hood. The unit also has a large closet in addition to smaller closets.
This unit is rent controlled.
The unit has double paned windows and is located at the front of the building for maximum sunshine. It also features an extra large living room (see the pic). One of the bedrooms has a large closet, see pic. 
The building is a short walk to USF and thus we do have some USF students residing in the building, but no wild parties and no pets. No smoking. The owners pays for garbage and water.  The depositi is 1 and 1/2 times the monthly rent. The unit is available for immediate move in. No pets and no smoking.
