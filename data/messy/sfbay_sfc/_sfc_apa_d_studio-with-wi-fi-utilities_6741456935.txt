The Pacific Studio is an oasis of tranquility in one of San Francisco's most prestigious neighborhoods.  The studio is located in the back of a classic Pacific Heights building and features a view onto a professionally landscaped garden.  This quiet setting is only a block from the dynamic shopping and dining area of upper Fillmore Street.  The location of the property is very central and just one block away from public transportation.
You will enter the building lobby and climb the stairs to the second floor.  As you enter the studio, you will find a Queen sized bed, a dining table, and a desk.  There is a full bank of windows in the bedroom overlooking a deck and a beautiful back garden.  A small dining table and two chairs are in front of the windows. The kitchen is separate and fully stocked.  At the end of the hall there is a full bathroom, including a bathtub.
The deck is shared with one other unit and guests also have access to the garden.  There is a coin-operated laundry in the basement.  
Pacific Heights is a very desirable neighborhood in north-central San Francisco.  The Marina district is just up and over the hill.  Enjoy upper Fillmore Street or walk down Fillmore to Japantown or the newly resurgent Jazz district. 
Our Pacific Studio is perfect for a couple or individuals who require an extended stay in San Francisco.  The great natural light, comfortable furnishings, and excellent location make our Pacific Studio a good choice for any visitor.
