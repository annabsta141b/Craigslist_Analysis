Large windows in each of the two-, three- and four-bedroom configurations provide generous natural light and - in some cases - Pacific Ocean views that rival those of neighboring Sea Cliff. Though the standard foghorn soundtrack might say otherwise, sunsets here are more often fiery oranges and reds than shades of gray.Outside, native plants and grasses share space with organic community gardens, neighborhood gathering spaces, bike racks, and playgrounds. Nearby stops for the PresidiGo Shuttle make for easy access to the Presidio's Main Post and the free shuttle to downtown San Francisco.Get to Know the Presidio
