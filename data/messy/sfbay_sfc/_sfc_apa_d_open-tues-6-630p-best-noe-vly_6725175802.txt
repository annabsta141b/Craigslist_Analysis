This building has 5 apartments, and we rarely have turnover because people like living here!
It is located on a coveted block.  Elizabeth is a desirable street parallel to 24th Street between Noe and Sanchez.  Close to Whole Foods, restaurants, cafes, transportation and so much more.  It is a must have location.  The apartment is comfortable / cute.  So, not huge but very functional.  
Rent does not include utilities.  Deposit is 2 times the rent.  Tenant must be well qualified.
We have great people in this building and are looking forward to keeping the harmony.
Sorry PLEASE NO DOGS.  It just doesn't work in this one, and again we are sorry.  
Please note, photos are from 5 years ago, so some minor changes.  For example the tree is no longer in front of the bedroom and living room window, which allows for more natural light!
