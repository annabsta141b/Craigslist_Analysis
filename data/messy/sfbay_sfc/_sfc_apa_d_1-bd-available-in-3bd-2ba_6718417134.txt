Hi! We have a bedroom with a shared bath available in our 3 bedroom Outer Richmond Apartment. We are located at 25th and Clement, only a short walk to Baker Beach, restaurants, and shops. Location has easy bus access to downtown as well.
About the place: Spacious apartment with huge open living room, big kitchen, and dining room. Place has dishwasher and shared laundry in the building. Room available has a large closet and shares a bathroom with only one other roommate. Utilities run about $75 per month.
About us: We are in our late 20's working full time. One works as a buyer for Wal-mart and the other is an attorney in Marin County. We are typically home on weeknights cooking and catching up on TV with a glass of wine. 
About you: We are looking for someone with a similar 8am to 5pm work schedule who doesn't smoke and is comfortable keeping things low-key on weeknights. Must also be gay-friendly. Unfortunately no pets allowed.
If you think you would be a good fit, please email us with a little about yourself! We are looking to fill the room by October 15th but end of October is also an option for the right person.
