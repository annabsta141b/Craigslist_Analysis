Nob Hill is so beautiful, it's hard to believe that people actually live here. But they do. . .and you can too. Hotels, boutiques and fine dining spots top the lofty locale. The Top of the Mark, Keiko.Nob Hill and Soda Popinsksi's are just a few local faves that give the area its fizz. Nob Hill is the ideal base for exploration. North Beach, Chinatown, Union Square, Financial District -- it's all downhill from here.
