For breakfast, the Ferry Building offers a robust farmers' market, Blue Bottle Coffee, and the flagship store of Cowgirl Creamery.
Yerba Buena Center for the Arts is a nearby cultural hub, offering adventurous theater, dance, music, and film series. City Kayak rents boats for those who want to explore the area by water. HD Buttercup provides the latest in home decor, from eclectic couches to classic furniture sets.
