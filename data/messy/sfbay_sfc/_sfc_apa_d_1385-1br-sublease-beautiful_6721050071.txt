Sublease a beautiful room in the Haight for November-January (potentially longer) $1385 per month + utilities + $2025 security deposit.  
Live in a large and beautiful room with 3 bay windows. 
The Apartment: Victorian and pretty. It has all that great San Francisco detailing; wainscoting, hardwood floors, molding. 2nd floor unit in a 3 story building. 1 split bathroom. Free washer/dryer. Sun room. Back porch. Backyard. Decent sized kitchen with pantry. Big living room. An unbelievably large spice rack (our pride and joy). There is no garage available - street parking only. No pets allowed either, even though we love animals. 
The Hood: Broderick and Oak or Page (all depends on how you look at that sort of thing). It's super close to the Panhandle, Golden Gate Park, the Lower Haight, the Haight, Divis, Castro, Duboce Park, lots of bus lines, bike lanes, Falletti Foods, BiRite, restaurants, shops, the Independent, and a darling Sunday Farmer's Market. Really the best place to live in the city. The Roommates: There are 5 total spaces in the flat. Seems like a lot, but it never feels crowded and each of us has the whole place to ourselves quite often due to travel or work schedules. We are all pretty awesome. We can socialize over dinner, cooking in the kitchen, or all going out together. We're lots of fun, intelligent, goofy, and respectful of each other. We make an effort to keep the place clean and tidy. We want someone that fits into our mix and can be a part of what we already share.
Roommate 1 (32) - Roommate 1 is currently studying somatic therapy, and is also a product designer/maker who enjoys a wide variety of activities. He feels most at home in the great outdoors and enjoys rock climbing, yoga, naps, non-pretentious yet intelligent conversations, cooking, building and designing things with his 3D printer and laser cutter.
Roommate 2 (24) - Earthling who enjoys dancing, crafting, and hopelessly learning banjo. She is also an animal and nature lover who wants a clean and tidy home that is cozy and welcoming after a long day at work.
communication is key for any roommate to be!
Roommate 3 (29) - Is a wannabe chef (he always makes the kitchen smell amazing), and works in the medical field helping people get back to health and mobility. He practices yoga like a boss and is just one heck of a stand-up guy. 
Roommate 4 (24) - Is a Business Intelligence consultant, always learning new things and challenging himself to grow. He is truly an inspiration to be around - a gentleman and a scholar. 
Roomate 5 You?
Send us an email telling us a little about yourself. Go on, don't be shy. 
How old are you? 
We'd like to know how you spend your days,
how many days a week you would plan on being here,
what your favorite thing about San Francisco is, and really anything you think we should know about you.
When are you available to see the apartment (weeknights and weekends)?
We're looking forward to meeting you!
