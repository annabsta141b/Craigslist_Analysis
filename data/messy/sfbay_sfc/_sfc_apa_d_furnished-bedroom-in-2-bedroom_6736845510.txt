I have a furnished bedroom in an adorable 2 bedroom in the Inner Richmond! Looking for someone to move in ASAP, early November. Ladies only please, minimum 1 month stay but if you'd like to stay longer, sure thing! Great location, nonstop bus to the FiDi is across the street, takes about 15-20 min, right by yummy food on Clement street and next to the Presidio.
