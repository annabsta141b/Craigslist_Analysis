One of the rooms in my 2 BR Apartment is opening up and I'm looking to fill it ASAP. 
A little about the area:
- The apartment is located in the heart of Cow Hollow, specifically in between Laguna St. and Buchanan St. We are the top apartment so no noise above the apartment. The Urban Remedy juice shop is below us.
- There's great restaurants and bars all around the apartment. Some of the most popular spots include Marengo, Italian Homemade and Perry's.
- Neighborhood bars and staples to the area are Bus Stop and Blue Light.
- Commuting to and from the apartment is super easy. Two public transportation options are SF MUNI (the bus) which picks you up ~20 steps to the right from our front door and Chariot ~20 steps to the left of the front door.
- The apartment is 5 minute walking distance to one of the most desirable views/parks in the entire city: Marina Green and Crissy Field. If you're active and like to get outside, this apartment is great for being able to do that.
A little about me:
- Easy going guy in my mid-late 20's. I've lived in this place for a while and appreciate keeping it tidy. I'm not a clean freak but air on the side of keeping things tidy and respectable for others.
- I enjoy watching sports on the weekends, Netflix etc. 
- I work at a health tech start up and lead our Business Development efforts for the past 4+ years. I travel quite a bit for work (~1 week per month).
- Looking for someone who is not bringing the party back from the bars but can enjoy the pros of living near that scene. Also pays rent on time, every month :)
Text/email me directly if you're seriously interested!
Ideal move in date is ASAP October 15th. Open to an end of October move-in date as well.
