Stylishly furnished apartment in the heart of San Francisco, a block away from Cable Car line.
Subletting my place for half a year, maybe longer.
This beautiful Victorian home is within walking distance to Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf, Cable Car Museum, Chinatown and North Beach. It is steps away from Grace Cathedral, close to Polk street with trendy cafes, modern boutiques, wine bars and fabulous restaurants offering every kind of cuisine you can imagine.
The apartment has a spacious living room, beautiful hardwood flooring and large bedroom windows. The walls are are colorful and adorned with funky paintings. 
You will love my place located in safe neighborhood with great coffee shops and friendly atmosphere. 
Perfect for young professional or person in transition. I am looking to sublet my place to a single professional, preferably girl, that will keep it clean and organized. The building has strict pet policy, so sorry for our loved ones.
