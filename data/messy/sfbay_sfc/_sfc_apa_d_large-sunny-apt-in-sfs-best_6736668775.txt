Welcome to a spacious, fully furnished, 2 bed + 2 bath apartment!
This apartment is in the 'locals neighborhood' of SF! A couple blocks from Golden Gate Park, and in the heart of the Richmond District. Walk to hole-in-the-wall restaurants, music festivals, museums, gardens, hiking trails, USF, Presidio, and the Haight. An easy commute by public transportation or Uber/Lyft to anywhere in The City.
The bedrooms are designed with comfort in mind:
-Casper-Queen mattresses with crisp white sheets, pillows, and bed covers. Beds are brand new!
-Thuma bedframes for comfort and a great night's sleep
-Large closets for plenty of storage
-Big bathrooms for plenty of self care
The apartment is equally comfy:
-A couch in the family room for chill time
-Large patio off the living room, for taking in a cup of coffee + the fresh air off of Ocean Beach.
-Electric stove, fridge + freezer, dishwasher, garbage disposal, and plenty of cabinets for the chef who wants to take advantage of all of California's fresh meats and veggies.
-The apartment is on the second floor, on the back of the building, so no street noise (15 steps are involved in getting up to the apartment)
-Laundry is free, in the building!
Apt is ready for viewing, so email over your LinkedIn profile, a bit about yourself, and availability timing for coming to view the apt!!
thx!
