Imagine a neighborhood set high over the Bay, with the East Bay's lights glittering on the horizon and hundreds of acres of parkland in the front yard. Imagine it's undergoing a steady process of revitalization, with stores, restaurants and coffee houses planned nearby. Imagine this neighborhood as a quiet residential area with easy access to BART, Muni and freeways. This imagination is reality at a location of a dazzling modern new development, carved dramatically into a hillside high above the Bay - the High Point community in San Francisco offers beautiful condominiums uniquely designed to meet every lifestyle.
