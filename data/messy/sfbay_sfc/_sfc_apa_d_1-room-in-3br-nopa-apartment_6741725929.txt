We are both in our mid twenties. I work for a startup accelerator downtown and he works for a startup in the design district. We both enjoy getting outside-camping, hiking, biking, running, snowboarding, laying in park etc. We also enjoy some indoor activities-cooking, yoga, movies, reading, etc. 
Looking for a clean, down to earth, friendly, considerate person to share the space. Cleanliness is key ;) 
Available for move-in on November 15th. We would like for you to sign a 6 month-12 month lease. Terms are negotiable.
