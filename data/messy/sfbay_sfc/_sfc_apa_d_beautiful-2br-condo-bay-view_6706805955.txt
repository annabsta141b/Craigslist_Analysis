333 Bush Street is an amazing building in the heart of the financial district. Condo #3805 is up for rent with a 12-month lease.
It's the only residential building in the financial district that has 24/7 security and stunning views of the Bay. You'll be able to see fireworks on July 4 and have a live view of America's Cup.
Features:
- 24/7 security and doorman. All of the building staff are super nice and will know you by name. It feels truly like home.
- Private residential entrance that goes only to the top floors of the building
- Barry's Bootcamp, Escape from New York Pizza, Cafe Claude, and dozens of amazing restaurants right downstairs.
- Parking garage in the building. Electric charging available.
- Storage unit on the same floor, right across the hall in case you have extra belongings to stash away.
- Laundry and dryer are in unit.
- Laundy Locker will pick up directly from the building.
- Unit is on the 38th floor which means you won't hear sirens or other annoying sounds in the middle of the night.
- Easy to work with landlord who will never bother you :)
The condo is available almost immediately. Flexible move-in date. Email for more details or if you want to come for a tour! 
We are expecting this to rent out very quickly as other units in the building are going for upwards of $8k/month! (Run a Craigslist search for 333 Bush and you will know what I mean)
