Lower Pacific Heights is the dressed down answer to it's tonier sister borough. This central setting is a multi-culti mash-up. Fillmore's jazzy roots and Japantown's blossoming community are two of the area's most vibrant influences.
Sophisticated street view meets a sleek interior in this Lower Pac Heights midrise. Pretty period details like porticoes and crown-molding showcase the vintage of this rebooted classic building. Hardwood floors and contemporary kitchen complete the package.
