Pristine, new 1 BR/BA | 597 sq/ft available for immediate move in. We had to break our lease, and are looking for someone to take over ASAP, so we are willing to pay for your move-in expenses (i.e. up to $500 for rental and labor). 
We are all moved out. Hence, we are willing to incentivize someone to move in early rather than be locked in to rent for months. Our leasor is Potrero 1010 and management is aware of this post as well as our offer to pay for your move-in. The building is walking distance to UCSF, Whole Foods, Safeway, Muni, Caltrain, and Google Bus. Extremely pet-friendly with a dog park and grooming salon! Amenities include fitness center, community club rooms, and rooftop terrace with grills. ZipCar Vehicles and Ford Bikes onsite.
Here is the official post on 
their site - httpswww.equityapartments.com/san-francisco/potrero-hill/potrero-1010-apartments##unit-availability-tile. The current listing price fluctuates depending on the market.
Steps: Get in touch with Potrero 1010, book a viewing, and text us so we can arrange your move-in after you've signed the lease. Last we checked, a truck rental + labor for the afternoon is about $500.
Text or email if you'd like further information or have any questions.
