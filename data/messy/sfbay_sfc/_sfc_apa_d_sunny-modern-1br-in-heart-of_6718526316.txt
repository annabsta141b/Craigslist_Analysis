33 Tehama is an iconic new residence in the heart of SoMa in San Francisco. This one-bedroom is on the 27th floor with amazing views of the city. Amenities include: dishwasher, washer & dryer in unit, modern interior, shared sauna, hot tub, rooftop sky lounge, fitness center, valet parking and much more. It's walking distance to many shops and restaurants.
I am breaking my lease to move outside the city, so this would be for a 6-month lease which is great for those just moving the city! This is not a sublet situation, it's just a chance for someone to take a 6-month lease and renew later.
