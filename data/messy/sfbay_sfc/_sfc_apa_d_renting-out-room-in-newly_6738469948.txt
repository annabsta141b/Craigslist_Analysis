Hey everyone,
I know how hectic it can be looking for a decent and affordable place in the Bay Area can be so i am hoping i can help :)!
 I am looking for a professional  , ( late 20s, ,mid to late 30s) who is looking to rent out a room !!!
I have an apartment highrise that has a really  great city view, garage parking (for an additional monthly fee), in building laundry, gated community with 24 hr security, a pool and hot tub as well as a fitness center and is the one of the few high rises off the lake with rent control!I have Wifi, no cable - but are open to getting cable if needed and after utilities it will be about $1650. 
The high rise is conveniently located about 2 blocks from lake Merrit, 7 minute walk from lake Merritt Bart station, a 5 minute drive from Lakeshore avenue shopping and grocery stores. there are also a few bus stops around as well, and there is an abundance of street parking and its a quick 12 minute Bart ride into SF!
Please email me if you are interested in  viewing the place or want more information!
