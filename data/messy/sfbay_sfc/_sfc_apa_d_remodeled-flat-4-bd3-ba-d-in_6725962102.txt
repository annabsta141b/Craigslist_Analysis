This beautiful, newly remodeled duplex sits on an extremely quiet, tree-lined block, steps away from the Marina Green and Crissy Field.  The property affords the quintessential San Francisco lifestyle, due to its location in the Marina district and its proximity to the City's most desirable outdoor spaces and Chestnut Street.
The interior space is brand new and it benefits from a top to bottom remodel. The level of quality and refinement is clear from the moment one walks into the entry foyer, and is consistent throughout the entire interior space. Calming, neutral tones were used in the general color palette and a timeless, classically elegant design aesthetic is seen throughout every room.  
The Master Suite encompasses the entire 3rd floor of the property and it enjoys virtually unobstructed views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz.    Spanning almost 1,000 square feet, the master suite creates an opulent, relaxing atmosphere throughout.   Rarely do properties of this caliber come onto the rental market, so act quickly.
