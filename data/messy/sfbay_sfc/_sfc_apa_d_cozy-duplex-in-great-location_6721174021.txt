This single-bedroom home including bonus room/office is located in the Potrero Hill neighborhood in San Francisco. It is a mere seventeen-minute walk from the Bullet Baby Bullet, the Limited Limited and the Local Local at the 22nd Street Caltrain stop. Bus stops are just a few steps away from the building. With pretty decent walk and bike scores, this location is rated very walkable and most errands can be accomplished on foot, and even more efficiently on a bike. Nearby shops, restaurants, and offices are all within a ten-minute walking radius. 
The interior features hardwood flooring and rich white-painted walls. The living and dining room are wide and spacious and would easily fit a full entertainment system. The kitchen features classic rustic cupboards and drawers, smooth granite countertops, and ready-to-use stainless steel appliances. Thanks to strategically-placed lighting fixtures and huge windows that allow ample natural light to enter, the place feels bright and sun-filled during the day yet still well-lit at night. In-unit washer and dryer are provided as well as ample storage space.
