Noe Valley 2Bed/1Bath Penthouse Apartment available for 1 year Lease
Welcome Home!
This lovely top floor apartment features newer (and freshly shampooed) wall-to-wall carpeting, newer oven and microwave, double-paned windows, a light filled living room with groovy retro gas fireplace, forced-air (central) heating, an eat-in kitchen, also with views, two spacious bedrooms (one with a downtown view) and a skylight in the bathroom.
Sorry, no smoking and no pets as there is a newer carpet in home.  
On site washer/dryer and easy street parking. 
First+$3500 Damage Deposit+Satisfactory Credit/Employment and Rental History=1 Year Lease.  
As this is a cool retro mid-Century building, SF Rent Control applies.
What a deal!
