I am looking to transfer the lease on my apartment in the Dogpatch as soon as possible; you would be assuming my lease which ends at the end of February, 2019. 
The location is great, 8 minute walk to 22nd street CalTrain and on the same block as a stop for 3rd street Muni tram heading downtown. I do not have any pets, but they are allowed in the building with an additional fee.
The rent is $3,800/month.
Utilities and garbage usually runs around $80 per month but that includes concierge garbage service (it is picked-up from the front door). 
Deposit:
$900 security deposit
Please email me if you have any questions or if you'd like to see the unit.
