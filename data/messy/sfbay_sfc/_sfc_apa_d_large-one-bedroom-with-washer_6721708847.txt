Comfort and Enjoyment  Located near the northeast corner of San Francisco, Nob Hill has some of the most beautiful architecture in the city. The neighborhood was built on one of the city's 44 hills, affording its residents breathtaking views of the San Francisco Bay and Marin County, as well as Alcatraz and the Marina District. Nob Hill can be found due north of the Union Square shopping district and Market Street, and also borders on Chinatown and the Financial District. Originally called California Hill, after the street that climbs up the hill's eastern face, it was renamed Nob Hill after the Central Pacific Railroad's "Big Four," Leland Stratford, Collis Peter Huntington, Mark Hopkins and Charles Crocker, called The Nobs, built mansions there. This area still retains many of these qualities, from beautiful parks to perfectly preserved homes and churches. Today, a wealthy urban professional population rubs shoulders with some of the city's oldest families here.  Call Now:  show contact info
