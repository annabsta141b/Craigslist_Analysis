Perfect for a traveling nurse or anyone who wants a home away from home in the Bay Area!
Enjoy a beautiful, peaceful retreat just ten miles from San Francisco and minutes from Berkeley.  After a long day, come home to this peaceful condominium surrounded by lakes, a couple minute walk to the Bay and adjacent to preserved wetlands.  
This recently renovated, second floor, corner unit is open and spacious, with two bedrooms and two full bathrooms.
Minimalist, spa-inspired style includes everything you need to feel at home including kitchen supplies and linens. King size bed in master. Washer and dryer in condo. Off street parking. Gated community. And we love pets!
No smoking condo (including in unit) except in designated areas. 
WiFi and utilities included.
I was a tenant here and stop by on Wednesday nights to tend to the plants and check the mail for the owner. I spend the night in an adjacent space and leave Thursday morning. I'm warm and fuzzy and am happy to walk your dog or chat or to leave you totally in peace. :)
