Located in between the Fillmore neighborhood right next to Japantown and all of the fabulous cheap eats and social bars on Polk Street, you'll find this apartment both relaxing and central. It's decorated with a zen them with art purchased in Indonesia and Thailand. The kitchen is full sized with everything you could possibly need to cook at home. Plus, the kitchen has a large desk and computer chair with a view over looking the city. When you walk in to this large studio, which functions more like a Junior 1-bedroom - you'll be pleasantly surprised at how light and airy it is with incredible views of the city. There is also a full size bathroom with beautiful tiling and a ceramic tub/shower combo and a walk-in closet that I will clear some space out of for you. 
The arrangement would be from November 15th (I can leave up to a week earlier, if necessary) through January 1, 2018 (I'm open to longer arrangement as well, but will depend on my project). And technically, you would be a roommate, so I'd notify my landlord that you're in the building. We'd sign our own contract. 
Price is $1800 per month, plus $100 cleaning fee. 
The place:
- California king bed
- Full kitchen with everything you need to cook
- Speedy WiFi

Please contact me by email. If the ad is still posted, the place is still available. 
I'm looking for someone who is single (couples are not allowed as this is a roommate agreement), professional, and looking for a short-term option that's reasonably priced in the city.
