Hi!
We are looking for a third roommate to share our apartment with us for a 6 month sublet to start.   The room will be available on December 1st.   The room is approximately 10ftx11fx with 11ft ceilings.  The room is quite large and can fit a king size bed with room for a dresser and other belongings. The apartment has 2 bathrooms and you would be sharing the larger bathroom with Meyer.  The rent will be $1,200 a month with a $1,200 dollar deposit.  The rent does not include utilities, which normally are around $100 a month.   We have to pay for water, gas, electric, internet and trash.  The room will come completely unfurnished.
We have a great location being only a few blocks away from Golden Gate Park and Clement Street, where there are tons of great restaurants, stores and there is even a farmers market on Sundays.  It is very easy to get around the city and is close to many bus stops (38, 38R, 38BX, 31, 31BX, 33, 5, 5R).  It is about a 20 - 30 minute commute downtown during the morning and evenings.  There are multiple laundromats and stores near by for all of your everyday needs.   While we all love animals, we are not allowed to have any in the apartment.
We are looking for a laid back roommate who likes open communication and will fit well in our current apartment.   The place is typically pretty quiet but occasionally have a few friends over for drinks.  We do value keeping the place clean and have a cleaning schedule to make sure everyone is pitching in regularly.  We all get along great and sometimes hang out in the kitchen or living room but do our own things and have very diverse interests. 
A little about us:
Katie is 31 and works as an insurance broker downtown during the week.  Her schedule is 8-5ish during the week and spends a lot of time hanging out with family and friends.  She is a huge Giants fan and likes to spend as much time traveling as possible.
Meyer is 24 and works as a school counselor.  He also work normal hours during the week but gets some of the summer off.  He spends his spare time playing soccer, watching the Warriors and meeting people around town.
We hope to meet people after work next week to show the apartment and meet everyone.
