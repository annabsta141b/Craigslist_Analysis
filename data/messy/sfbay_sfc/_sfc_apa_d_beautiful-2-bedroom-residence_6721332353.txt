This beautiful 2 bedroom residence is located in the heart of South Beach. Live among all of the action at 88 Townsend Street. Residences at 88 Townsend feature a mix of warm modern interiors with a commitment to traditional hand craftsmanship which has resulted in crown molding, custom mill work Brazilian cherry kitchen cabinetry, granite counter tops, spa-like bathrooms, and generous closets. This spacious 1,169 sq. ft. (per appraiser) open concept home overlooks a bamboo courtyard and is an end corner unit. The generous living room space with high ceilings offers two sets of floor-to-ceiling windows and a separate dining area. The dining area comfortably accommodates a large table for formal dinner parties or holiday parties. A modern kitchen overlooks the living/dining area and also provides a breakfast nook for more casual dining. The kitchen is complemented with the convenience and comfort of stainless steel appliances including a gas range, refrigerator, microwave and Bosch dishwasher. The master bedroom includes a large walk-in closet and an en-suite bathroom with dual vanity sinks, storage, and a shower-over-tub. The second bedroom is perfect for a roommate, guest bedroom, or dedicated office and has its own double-door closet and courtyard views.
Located at Townsend and 2nd Street, this 10-year-old building tastefully blends its historic 1882 warehouse facade with the contemporary styling of its 4-story brick addition. Elevators provide easy access for tenants and guests.
