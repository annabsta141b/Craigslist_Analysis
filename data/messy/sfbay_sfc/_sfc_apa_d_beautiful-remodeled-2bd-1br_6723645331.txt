The Victorian homes are one of the biggest features found in Laurel Heights, providing beautiful architecture with each turn you take. California Street is where you can find the main shopping and dining options. If you want something more ethnic, eateries and shops are further down the street. Magic Flute Garden Ristorante is an Italian style restaurant providing a cottage-like feel, as well as a full open deck.
JCCSF is a community center that puts on various events throughout the year, while the UCSF Laurel Heights Campus is just across the street for higher education learning. The Presidio Heights Play Center boasts a large play center, basketball courts, sandbox and clubhouse for further entertainment. Laurel Heights is also home to York Creek Vineyards, where you're able to enjoy wine tastings and a tour. Laurel Heights is a quiet area that is within close distance to many amenities.
