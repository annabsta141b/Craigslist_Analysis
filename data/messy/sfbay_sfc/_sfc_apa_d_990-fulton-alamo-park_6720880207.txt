Alamo Square has an international fan base thanks to the "Painted Ladies" and their breathtaking backdrop -- hi def views of the San Francisco skyline. The area is also a favorite of food aficionados. Must-try delicacies include vino on tap at Wine Kitchen, collard greens at Ethiopian dive bar, Waziema, and ribs at 4505 BBQ.
