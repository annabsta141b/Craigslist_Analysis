Single room available ASAP for two month lease(month to month after that). This is a dorm style room with a bunk bed(sofa on the bottom, bed on top), mini fridge, desk, clothes shelf and small granite countertop with microwave and sink in the room. There are two common bathrooms per floor with showers that are neat and cleaned multiple times a week. 
I had originally signed a lease through the end of the year, but I had an opportunity to move into a place with a friend so I'm looking for someone to continue this lease through the end of the year.
