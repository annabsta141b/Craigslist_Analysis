This one bedroom studio is more spacious thank your typical studio. It has a sizable kitchen, a closet, and of course the living area. There is plenty of natural light, large windows, and hardwood floors throughout. 
Living area: Size-able space with huge bay windows overlooking Potrero Hill. Images show a semi furnished space but allows for a good sized couch, bookshelf, and trundle bed (still enough space for a small table). It's easy to be creative with the space. 
Closet: A nice walk in with plenty of shelving storage space. 
Kitchen: Has all the basic amenities including a gas stove, refrigerator, and a nice 'island' counter that separates it from the living space. This makes the studio more home-like. It also has a great window above the sink which lets plenty of light in and tile on the floors. 
Bathroom: Great water pressure, a window to let in natural light, and a shower with bathtub. There is some storage space under the sink.
Studio is 2,245/month with all utilities included.
