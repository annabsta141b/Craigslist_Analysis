Please come check out our recently remodeled and modern 2BR/1BA - it features tons of natural light, hardwood floors throughout, stainless steel appliances including microwave and dishwasher, double paned windows, central heating, granite counters, recessed lighting and an in-unit washer/dryer. It also comes furnished for additional fee if interested. 
While the unit is not huge (est. 700 sq foot), it's well-layed out with open floorplan (kitchen/living room) and would be perfect for roommates or a couple. Plus there's an outdoor patio which would be great for bbq'ing with friends!
The neighborhood is the Mission/Bernal Heights - so convenient access to restaurants, cafes, bakeries, ice creameries (Mitchells), and grocery (Safeway). Unit is 15 minutes walk to Glen Park Bart Station and 20 minutes to downtown via Muni. 
Small, well-behaved dogs and cats are welcome.
Utilities are not included. Parking is available but not included.
Please no smoking.
