JUNIOR 1 bedroom in 4 unit building. Newly remodeled with hardwood floors, stainless appliances and marble look tile. Small common outdoor space, shared laundry in garage, parking spots available for additional $300. AMAZING views. Available immediately.
The apartment is 8 blocks from Glen Park's downtown, which has strong local flavor including popular restaurants (from taquerias to fine dining), an independent grocer, coffee and gift shops. The renowned Destination Bakery and Bird and Becket Bookstore are famous throughout the city. Around the corner is Glen Park Canyon, a beautiful 70-acre park with hiking trails and wildlife -- one of SF's best-kept nature secrets.
In terms of location, it is a short walk to BART, several MUNI bus lines, and many of the South Bay/Peninsula corporate buses (including Google, Apple and Genentech). If you have a car, both highways 280 and 101 are minutes away (perfect for people commuting to the Peninsula or South Bay), and on-street parking is plentiful.
Sorry, no pets or smokers!
