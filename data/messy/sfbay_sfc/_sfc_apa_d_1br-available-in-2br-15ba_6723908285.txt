Hi! I unfortunately am leaving San Francisco and my roommate after 2.5 years of enjoying this awesome area and friendship. Looking to fill room immediately due to job change. 
Looking for an active social individual to take my space who is easy to get along with. Roommate is mid-20's guy, avid surfer and weekend adventurer who works in tech from mid-west. 
Large bedroom (room for a Queen bed with plenty of walk around space) and closet available in 2BR/1.5BA apartment. Bedroom will not be furnished. 
$1100 plus utilities split equally.
Large living area, dining area, and kitchen with new appliances. Large Bay windows, lots of natural light! 
1 enclosed parking space is available.
Water included in rent. PG&E/Internet to be split with roommate. 
Pictures can be provided upon request. Please share link to Facebook and a little about yourself. 
If this ad is up, room is still available.
