Mixing business with pleasure is what Downtown does best. Bustling with FiDi professionals and Union Square fashionistas by day, this energetic area lights up the San Francisco nights with bar-hoppers, theater crowds and dinner dates. Toast your productivity during happy hour at Hawthorn, munch on a Maverick burger at Bartlett Hall, or trek up to the Tunnel Top for a nightcap. This hive of activity is where the city comes to work and play. Right at home in Downtown's lively cultural cocktail, the Element Apartments at 540 Leavenworth is a commuter's dream. Need a place to chill after work? Take your pick from the Yoga Studio, Media Room, or Game Lounge. Watch the sunset from the Rooftop Terrace. There's even a dog run for those foggy nights when your fluffy best friend wants to stay in. Hardwood floors, exposed brick, stainless steel appliances and pre-wired in-residence tech will make it hard not to humblebrag.
