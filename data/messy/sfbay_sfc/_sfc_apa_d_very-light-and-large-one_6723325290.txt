This large one bedroom unit has lots of light, hardwood floors and a porch swing for Summer warm days. This building has an older style layout, as it was probably built in the 1870's and somehow survived the earthquake and fire in 1906. It does have all the modern conveniences of a kitchen and laundry room in the unit. There are large skylights which flood the kitchen with light and a back porch for growing orchids.
