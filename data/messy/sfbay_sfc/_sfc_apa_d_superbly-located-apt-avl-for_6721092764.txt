Hey there! My roommate just moved out, and I need a roomie urgently to share this apartment, located in south of market, san francisco. With ceilings as high as nine feet, the apartment has a spacious layout, and offers beautiful views of the brannan street and redwood grove. The apartment is ready for possession with a central cooling system, in-unit laundry utilities, and more. What adds to the appeal of this apartment is the amazing range of entertainment arenas provided by the community. From a 24*7 fitness center to an expansive community library, the apartment complex has something for everyone! Show off your culinary skills at the resident lounge and kitchen, or simply take your friends skygazing at the rooftop deck! The neighbourhood offers a secure and vibrant environment, and an amazing nightlife with a barrage of cafes, restaurants, and clubs in the vicinity. If you're interested, hit me up asap at: https://roomalways.Com/lh99
