One bedroom apartment available 11/1 in quiet garden setting in peaceful residential neighborhood.  Unit is 800 Sqft with dishwasher and W/D in unit.  It is in the rear of a large residential home on the main level.   Lots of privacy.  Lovely garden views out all windows.  Very easy street parking, conveniently located to public transport and all major freeways.  Partially furnished.  
Strong preference for one quiet professional person who appreciates a serene environment.   
I'm sorry but no pets are allowed, no exceptions.  
Rent is 2300 plus a portion of utilities.  
Very high speed internet is installed in unit.
