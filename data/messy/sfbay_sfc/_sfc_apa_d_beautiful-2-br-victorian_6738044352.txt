Beautiful, spacious Victorian apartment (approx. 980 sq. ft), with two large bedrooms, original Douglas Fir wood floors and trim, period lighting fixtures, and high ceilings. Large circular windows in the living room & one bedroom face south and provide amazing light. Kitchen has granite countertop. Tiled bathroom with claw foot tub.  The unit is in an 1880's six-unit building where owner lives, complete with a beautifully landscaped backyard garden enclosed by Japanese fence.  Unique from SF's typical "railroad flat" structures, here there is no adjacent building to the East, so that the entire apartment gets great sunlight.  Laundry facilities are in the building. The location is ideal, in the heart of San Francisco's most vibrant neighborhood, right across from the Page Street Library, near USF, Buena Vista Park, The Panhandle, NoPa, UCSF, Kezar Stadium, a block from the shops, markets, and restaurants on Haight Street and Golden Gate Park as well as only three minute's walk to Cole Valley. Great access to public transportation, including Muni lines Nos. 6, 71, 33, 37, 43 as well as the N-Judah.  Close to car shares and shuttles.  Transit Score: 78.  Walk score: 97 - "walker's paradise".  Bike score: 98 - "biker's paradise."  Small single vehicle garage parking may be available under a separate contract for an extra charge.  One-year lease required along with security deposit.  Sorry, no pets or tobacco smokers.  If interested, please be prepared to provide a copy of your credit report, along with the usual rental application info.
