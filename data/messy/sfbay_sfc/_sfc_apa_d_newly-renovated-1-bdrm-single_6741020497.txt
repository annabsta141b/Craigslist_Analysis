This apartment is available now, and we are looking to find tenants ASAP. It's a fully updated 1+ bedroom (the + is a quirky but large, low-ceiling, lofted attic space with skylights), single-story Victorian with a sunny deck near Precita Park in Bernal Heights. Rent includes a dedicated, small parking space in front of the garage (on the street). It does NOT include the garage or other bills like PG&E, trash, and water, which are the tenant's responsibility (trash bills are shared with the neighboring unit behind). 
We are looking for:
•	1 year lease minimum, starting ASAP. Rent will be pro-rated to the 1st  of the month
•	2 months cash deposit 
•	No pets, please (we love animals, but we can't allow them)
•	Non-smoking only 
We are currently showing it by appointment only. Please call Jessica at  show contact info
 to schedule an appointment. Serious inquiries only, bring a rental application (standard), and a credit report.  We use the most recent SF Apartment Association (SFAA) contracts.
This apartment features: 
•	1-2 bedroom. It is most often used as a 1 bedroom, as the second "bedroom" is a renovated, low-ceiling, lofted 
        attic space
•	Newly remodeled kitchen 
•	Newly remodeled bathroom
•	Hardwood floors 
•	New kitchen appliances 
•	New paint, inside and out
•	No laundry on site, but there is a laundmat a block away
•	Large, open deck
•	Walking distance to 24th Street BART and to the Mission/Valencia corridor with nightlife, cafe's, and 
        shopping
•	Great neighbors and neighborhood (ask anyone!)
•	Less than one block from Precita park (cafe's, laundry, community park) and a short (albeit steep) walk to 
        the top of Bernal Hill (with STUNNING VIEWS of the city)
•	Some of the best weather in the city (it's the "sunbelt")
•	Awesome and responsive landlords that live in the area and care deeply about this community (this is a 
        father-daughter family business- we are not a typical management company!)
