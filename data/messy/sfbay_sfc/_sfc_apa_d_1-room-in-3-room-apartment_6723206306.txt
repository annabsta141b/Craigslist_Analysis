The room is approximately 12x9 feet. Has a decent sized closet.
Rent is $1,065, security deposit $1,130 (deposit is paid directly to the roommate moving out), internet $19.98 each and utilities average $45-85 each (colder months are on the higher end). Shared living room, kitchen, and bathroom. Landlord will require the new roommate and the other two roommates to sign a new 12-month lease. Room is available December 1, 2018.
We share the house with another family who lives in the downstairs apartment (they have a separate entrance). They are really nice. We share laundry and trash cans with them in the backyard. They also have kids, so no parties. It is also a quiet neighborhood so if you like to throw many parties then this is not a good option for you.
The house is in the Silver Terrace neighborhood (Bayview District near the Portola). Street parking only. Close to 4 bus routes, the 8, 9, 24, and 44. Glen Park BART is nearby (44 takes you there). We have gas stations, multiple grocery stores, restaurants, and a Walgreens in walking distance. Also really close to both the 101 and 280 freeways.
About us: 1 guy (mid-30s) and 1 gal (mid-20s). Both of us are artists and we work in luxury retail (her) and museum/higher education (him). We are looking for someone who is clean, respectful, and responsible. Please note that no pets are allowed and the room available is for one person only. Please contact us with any questions and also tell us about yourself.
