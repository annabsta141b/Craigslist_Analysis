Hello!
I am looking for someone to take over my studio lease from the mid of December (dates are flexible) till the 10th of July (and of course you can extend later). I have modern fully furnished studio on Mission Street of San - Francisco in a secure building. The studio is perfect for a single occupant or for a couple. Fully equipped kitchen includes stove, microwave, oven, toaster, blender, coffee machine, kettle, full set of cutleries and and dishes. Big bathroom with tub. Living space is separated from the "bedroom" so there will be enough privacy for 2 people. Walk - in closet with many hangers. The studio is up to 20th floor with a good inner garden view. The studio is facing south and I have lots of  natural lights (actually I never turn on light before 7.30 pm what helps a lot to save electricity). No noise neighbours around, far from elevators and laundry. The building itself is secure with 24H front desk. We also have parking, gym, laundry on every floor (really clean! we have housekeeping ladies who are cleaning it few times per day) and bike storage. Muni and bart stations are 1 minutes from the building. Few supermarkets are 10 minutes walk from, CVS, Walgreens, Starbucks close by. 
Rent is $2649 per month + utilities. 
I am ready to show the apartment for a potential tenants. 
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
