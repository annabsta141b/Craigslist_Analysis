Up for grabs: one unfurnished room in a beautiful 2 bedroom apt, located steps away from the Marina Green. It's got water and park views from the bedroom and is ready for move in now!
The location is the perfect balance of quiet, but centrally located 7 mins walking from Chestnut St, Fort Mason, the Palace of Fine Arts, and more. The unit is very well laid out, with fantastic space optimization, good natural light, great water pressure, and a rooftop deck overlooking the bridge. It has a small dishwasher, on-site laundry, and while the oven looks old it is amazing. Parking is very very easy. Spaces are typically abundant within the block.
Prefer a roommate on a 6 month lease, with month to month after that and 30 days notice. Open to proposed alternatives (longer or shorter).
Me: 30 y/o, I work in tech, like EDM (but don't bring the party back), hiking, and hang gliding. I have a very well behaved 10 year old Golden retriever who is with me most all of the time. I won't expect a roommate to take care of him, but someone who likes dogs is a plus. I'm reasonably clean, and a good roommate. Hoping for same with a stable job who is also respectful of the space.
Please note, the building does not allow smokers.
Drop me a note with a little about yourself, and a phone number so I can get back in touch with you! If you have questions, feel free to text them.
