Hi there! My partner and I have a three bedroom for rent at Irving and 48th by the beach. We have two options available:
$1850/month for one bedroom and a half of a room(bedroom size) to use as storage or office~ couples ok and welcomed! Parking space optional. 
Another option: Two separate bedrooms, one for $1200 and the other for $1100. The slightly smaller of the two does not have a closet. 
About us: We are a busy couple one in our late twenties and the other mid forties. I am a nursing student at USF and an EMT at Genentech. My partner works for a prestigious theater downtown. We have a small house trained white fluffy dog (3 years old) that is in our room when we are gone. Unlikely that another dog would work though a cat may. Our dog may want to play)
Our ideal roommates: Easy going, responsible and clean. Furniture is a plus as we are getting rid of a lot now and want to start fresh. Couples we would prefer to be in a committed long term relationship or students sharing a room would also be fine. Credit and background check will be done with the owners (who are super nice btw!) Must have references and the sooner you can move in the better! :)
Please let us know if you have any leads or questions~
