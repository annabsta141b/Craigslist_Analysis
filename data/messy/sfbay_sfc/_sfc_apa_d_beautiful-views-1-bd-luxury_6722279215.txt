A shared luxury apartment is available with a 12-month lease near the trendy neighbourhood of Potrero Hill. Located in the Design District of SoMa, the luxurious apartment comes with affordable rent and all deluxe amenities. I'm looking for an organised and peaceful person to share this gorgeous apartment with, and enjoy life in SF while staying in one of its best neighbourhoods.
