Location:
Every neighborhood in San Francisco has its own unique characteristics that set it apart from the rest of the city, while at the same time exuding an undertone that clearly denotes its San Francisco residency. The Inner Sunset is a perfect example, bubbling with diversity with a beat in-line with big city living.
Boasted as one of the most beloved neighborhoods by San Franciscans, the Inner Sunset has a laid-back, small-town feel with a funky edge that keeps the neighborhood fresh. Home to a widely diverse mix of people, the local businesses have no problem keeping up with the latest in cuisine and retail selections.
Its northern edge heads right into Golden Gate Park, a nicety that can quickly clog up any parking privileges privy to residential districts, particularly during large events and weekends. The Inner Sunset is also home to UCSF that serves as both a school and medical facility, which keeps the neighborhood buzzing with grad students and visitors who flock to the medical facility for the most innovative and advanced medical services in the country.
A walk down any street in the neighborhood will make it clear that the residents all know one another, nodding and chatting as they gather at mom-and-pop diners, drug stores, shoe repair shops, and small grocers on their daily outings.
