Short walk to USF, Golden Gate Park and Clement Street shops and restaurants.
This sunny 2 bedroom 1 bathroom unit is on the second floor of a well maintained three floor building and was recently vacated by three USF students.  The unit has new paint and was re-modeled two years ago with new wall to wall carpets throughout the apartment, new granite counter tops and kitchen area, new electric range, new refrigerator, new stainless steel sink, and new range hood.  
The unit has double paned windows and is located at the front of the building for maximum sunshine.  It also features an extra large living room (see the pic).  One of the bedrooms has a large closet, see pic.  
The building is a short walk to USF and thus we do have some USF students residing in the building, but no wild parties and no pets.  No smoking.  The owners pays for garbage and water.   
The unit is rent controlled.
Clement Street restaurants and Safeway are a ten minute walk.
The 38 and Balboa Street bus lines are a one and a half block walk and a short bus ride to downtown.
Short bus ride to downtown and the Mission.
Extremely convenient to major schools such as USF and UCSF.
