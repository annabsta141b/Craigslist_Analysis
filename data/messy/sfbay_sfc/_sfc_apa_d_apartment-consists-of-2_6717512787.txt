Wonderful natural light, quiet spot, and shared nice back yard with fruit trees. Apartment consists of 2 bedrooms, 1 bath, kitchen, living and dining open concept room. A pleasant and safe environment with newer appliances. I am looking for someone clean, organized, and considerate. 
House is located in the safe and convenient Merced Heights neighborhood. It is close to Junipero Serra boulevard and Holloway avenue. Nearby to Stonestown, 19th avenue, Ocean avenue, West Portal, SFSU and City College. Muni bus 29 stops at the corner.  A terrific neighborhood for enjoyment and commute.
