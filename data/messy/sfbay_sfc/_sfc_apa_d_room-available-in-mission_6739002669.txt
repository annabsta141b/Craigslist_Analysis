Our housemate is moving out of our 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom top floor apartment to move in with his girlfriend so looking for someone to live with us. 
About the apartment: Located in a quiet area that is walking distance to BART, great restaurants, parks, and tech shuttle stops. The apartment has in-unit washer/dryer and the interior was all recently renovated. Rent is $1790 / month. 
About the housemates: We are in our late 20's / early 30's and in tech and graphic design. Looking forward to meeting in person.
If you're interested, please send across a brief description about yourself and any social links (LinkedIn, FB, IG), that you're comfortable sharing. 
We're having folks come to see the apartment on Sunday, November 4 in the afternoon and evening if that works for you. Thanks!
