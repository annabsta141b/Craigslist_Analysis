Say hello to your new NOPA digs! Gather some friends (cheese and wine) and set up shop in Alamo Square Park for the afternoon. The dogs will run, the trees will sway, and the Painted Ladies will put on their best facade. When lounging in a beautiful park with a fantastic view becomes "too much", hit up The Mill for some liquid energy then check out a show at The Independent. 
Rate for first month only. Furnished apartment for short term rental.
