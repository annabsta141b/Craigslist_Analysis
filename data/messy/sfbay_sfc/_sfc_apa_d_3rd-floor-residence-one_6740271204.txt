Very comfortable 3rd floor (of 4) one bedroom with lots of natural light from 6 windows, hardwood floors, full-size and newer appliances, clawfoot tub, and perfect for discovering the City or commuting.  There are two downsides:  the neighborhood is lively and that means it's noisy--cars, trucks, delivery trucks, garbage trucks, and Sanchez fire station a block away--and our old elevator has been out of business for about a year and probably won't be fixed for a long while (as in years).  
This is a non-smoking apartment and no pets please.  
Owners are looking for a one year lease.  The security deposit is $4,990.00
