Classic San Francisco architecture coupled with vibrant urban touches give this quality Alamo Square condo the perfect mix of charm and modern style. The beautiful, bright and quiet 1 bedroom/1 bathroom/office approx. 1000 sq. ft. with 1 side-by-side secure garage parking and storage is located in a 1920's 4-unit Marina-style building located half a block from famous Alamo Square Park on a quiet tree-lined street. This prime location offers walking distance to many exciting neighborhoods (NOPA, Hayes Valley, lower/upper Haight, Castro, Fillmore, Panhandle, Golden Gate Park) and easy access to multiple transit options, public and private. 
Double French doors from the bedroom open to the very large and quiet living/dining room, creating a very spacious and open plan. Three bay windows in the living/dining room flood the rooms with natural light and overlook the beautiful rear garden with a view of Twin Peaks and sunsets. There is a bonus room off the living area perfect for an office/media room. All rooms feature designer accent paint which complements the modern and historical style of the unit. Contemporary recessed and track lighting is installed throughout the unit. 
The extra-large bedroom features a walk-in closet with a closet system and an additional set of double French doors leads to the hallway where a second walk-in closet is conveniently located. The remodeled bathroom contains a vintage tub with glass sliding doors, pedestal sink, limestone floors, subway tile and towel/accessories cabinet. The modern eat-in kitchen has stainless steel appliances, natural maple cabinets, Italian tile flooring, and a garden/herb window box. The kitchen back door opens to a shared porch where a staircase takes you to the garage and a shared sunny patio and garden filled with roses. 
The in-building secured garage parking accommodates a standard sized car and adjacent is approximately 40 square feet of extra storage (parking and storage included in rent). The free shared washer and dryer are located in the garage as well.
