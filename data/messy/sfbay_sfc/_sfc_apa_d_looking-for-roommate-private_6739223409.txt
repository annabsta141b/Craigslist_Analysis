I am looking for a girl-roommate, to share gorgeous 2bedroom/2Bath apartment, in nice Watergate resort. 
Apartment complexes are really cool! Pool, jacuzzi, gym, view ... area are very clean and safe.
Rooms in the apartment are very nice, with big windows and balcony.
Location is great! 
1. To get to the city usually takes 15 min. Uber or Lyft price from apartment to SF "Union Square" will be in range between $8-$15 (getting feeling that you live in SOMA but weather is better)
2. If traffic on the bridge, you still can get to the city in 15 min:
Step 1. Uber or Lyft price from apartment to Bart will be around $4 (5 min)
Step 2. Bart from "West Oakland" to "Powell" usually takes 7-8min
3. Also there are a carpool line, in morning to cross a bridge will be $1 :)
4. And of course free transportation from Emeryville Government - Free Bus "Emery Go Round" which will deliver you to the Bart station
