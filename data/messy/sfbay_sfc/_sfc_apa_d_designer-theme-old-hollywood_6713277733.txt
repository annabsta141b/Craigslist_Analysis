***This is a real apartment available for rent. Not a scam. We own the apartment and the whole building. Looking for nice tenants. We can meet and show you the apartment.  It has come to my attention that some scammer has been copying my ads.  Please make sure you are dealing directly with me.  I never rent to someone that I haven't met or spoken with over the phone / skype.  If you aren't in the city, then let me know if you have someone local that I can meet.  The security deposit and first month's rent is due on the first day of the lease.  Anyone asking for large sums of money up front from you is probably a scammer.  Please be aware.***
