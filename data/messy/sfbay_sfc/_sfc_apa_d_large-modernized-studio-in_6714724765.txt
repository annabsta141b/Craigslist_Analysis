Beautifully remodeled large studio in a 1920's Spanish Revival Building in the Vista del Mar/Sutro Height Neighbor of the Outer Richmond has Spectacular Spanning Ocean Views.  On a clear day, you can see all the way down the coast line to Pedro Point, south of Pacifica.  This corner unit has a large kitchen with dishwasher, 5 burner range, microwave/hood/light, under-counter sink and under-cabinet lighting.  Must see it to really appreciate it.Built in 1925, El Prado is a Spanish revival beauty that boasts some of the most spectacular ocean views in the Lincoln Park area. The restored lobby entrance leads you to spacious units flooded with natural light from large floor to ceiling windows. Private entry room, large walk in closets, newly remodeled kitchens with separate dining area. This spacious studio features classic retro elegance, period fixtures and details with all the modern conveniences. And El Prado is a few blocks from so many things to do, especially if you like outdoors and the ocean. Trails to hike and bike just are just a short walk down to Lands End and Lincoln Parks. Play a few rounds at the Lincoln Park golf course, see the latest exhibit at the Legion of Honor. Of course, you can always take off your shoes down at the beach to walk along the shore and perhaps fly a kite. For your convenience, we provide an on-site laundry. We also feature indoor parking for an additional monthly rent, but we only have a limited number and they are currently occupied.
