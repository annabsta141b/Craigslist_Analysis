DESCRIPTION
In a city with more than its share of beautiful, historic landmarks, there is one building that is about to begin its new Landmark life on the center of Market Street -- The Wilson. Built in 1904, then a survivor of the 1906 earthquake, The Wilson has been completely re-imagined and re-established for the 21st century resident seeking a home with a story to share for generations to come. Having seen the city grow-up and transform around it, The Wilson is now set to become the premiere address for residents looking to do more than just rent an apartment; The Wilson is for those looking to live the Landmark Life.
