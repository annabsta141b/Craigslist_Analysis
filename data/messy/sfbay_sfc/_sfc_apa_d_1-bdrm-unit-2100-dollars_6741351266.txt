This unit is located on the second floor. On the back of the building. It gets a good morning light and faces the alley on the back.
It has been entirely painted. It looks like new. Walgreens only 2 blocks up, MUNI/BART station three blocks down.
The LARKIN ST. just implemented 4 LED lighting posts in front of the building. So it has become very bright in our block at night.
