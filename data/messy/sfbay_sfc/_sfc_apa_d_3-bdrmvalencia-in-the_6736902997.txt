~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Neighborhood:
As the undisputed cultural heart of the city, the Mission has a progressive spirit that's constantly evolving and a soul that holds true to its historic Latino roots. Young, exciting, inventive, and flourishing--this is a community that's firing on all cylinders, and the energy is infectious. 1128 Valencia is perfectly located above a quaint  park-let setting between 22nd and 23rd Streets, at the core of the Mission's dynamic action and its trendy Valencia Street corridor--enabling residents walk to the hippest bars, restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues within seconds, or relax with friends at the bistro tables directly outside our front door.
The Mission also has the city's largest concentration of murals and street art, which proudly decorates buildings, fences, garage doors, alleys, and even the ground you're walking on. And let's not forget movies at the Roxie, live music at The Chapel, Amnesia, and Make Out Room, and theater at The Marsh or Brava Theater Center. There's never a shortage of things to explore--literally right outside your door.
The Mission's micro-climate tends to sit on the sunny side, boasting some of the best weather in the city. As a result, alfresco park-lets and biking abound, but people also flock to the grassy slopes of Dolores Park to catch some of the best views of the city.
