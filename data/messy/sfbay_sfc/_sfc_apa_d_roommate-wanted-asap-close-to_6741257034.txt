Located three blocks from Union Square, this apartment is highly accessible to downtown San Francisco. With a walk score of 99/100, this location is less than a ten minute walk to the 1-California, 6-Haight/Parnassus, 7-Haight/Noriega, and F-Market & Wharves buses, and the BART and MUNI Light Rails are just down the hill.
The room itself is about 10'x12', comfortably fits a queen bed and desk, and has a small closet (see pictures). The apartment has a spacious living room and kitchen with a walk-in pantry.
We pay for PG&E and cable/internet.
About Me:
My name is Mike (39), and I work in tech. I mostly keep to myself during the week, though I frequently have friends over on the weekends.
Please let me know when you would be interested in seeing the apartment firsthand!
Thanks :)
