Lower Nob Hill has a casual, laid-back feel and tons of overlap appeal. Polk Street's bar scene, Union Square shopping, FiDi business buzz, and of course, Nob Hill  polished heights, are easy excursions from this central neighborhood. There is also plenty within stumbling distance of your doorstep. Take your bromance for happy hour beers at Bacchus, ditch your diet at Pearl's, Deluxe Burgers or ease into a mid-week decompression session at Resolute winemaker Wednesdays.Taking it easy in Lower Nob Hill is a no-brainer.
