I'm going to sublet my apartment in the SF Mission District for at least a year. I'm going to live in the North Bay for awhile but plan to return to the City at some point after one year. 
Apartment is available to move in the first week in January. 
Written rental agreement would be month to month, but looking for people who plan to stay at least six months and up to a year, with possibility of extension.
Email me with your preferred time frame, thanks!
This is a top floor 3 to 4 bedroom apartment with 1 1/2 baths, that is suitable for up to 4 people living here. You can use the living room as a fourth bedroom if needed. All rooms have their own real walls/doors, no french doors or partitions. 
Living room/bedroom is large - 250 sq. ft.
There are two other large bedrooms - 156 sq. ft. and 144 sq. ft.
One smaller bedroom - 100 sq. ft., which also has a large walk in closet with shelves, 6 x 4 ft.
There is also a very large storage closet with shelves, drawers and clothing rack in the hallway - 13 x 4 ft.
The apartment can come semi-furnished if you would like, or I can clear it out completely. I have two beds that can stay (a twin and a queen), and possibly a third bed, and a bit of the furniture, such as IKEA wardrobes in two of the bedrooms, and some kitchen supplies.
The apartment is conveniently and centrally located in the Mission district, close to public transportation - BART and many Muni lines (14, 22, 49, 55, 33, J), as well as to Dolores Park, grocery shopping - Whole Foods, Bi Rite, Safeway, plus the shops, cafes, bars, restaurants on Valencia Street.
I keep a clean and quiet home and I'm looking for people who can maintain my home in this way while I'm away.
Please email me with an introduction of yourself and what you're looking for, such as number of people you're looking to rent with and length of stay. You are welcome to come by any weekday early evening, or weekend late mornings to see the apartment and I can also do a Skype/video call in advance to give you a visual virtual tour.
Thanks!
