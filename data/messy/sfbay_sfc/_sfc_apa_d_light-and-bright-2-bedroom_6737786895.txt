Light and bright 2-bedroom Edwardian apartment in the heart of SOMA. Open plan renovated kitchen with dining and living space. Sliding glass door that leads to a private deck space. Washer and dryer in the building. Perfect for people who work downtown 5 min walk from Civic center Bart, 10-minute bike ride to downtown and a 21-minute walk to downtown. Also great for people who work in the south bay since it is really close to the SOMA highway entrance and a 15-min walk to Cal train. The place is not furnished, and it is pet-friendly. Rent is 3,700 per month.
