Recently completed a full high end remodeling, this excellent 1bd view unit is located on the top floor of a mid century modern building, in a super convenient location.
The unit: 
Recently redone modern kitchen with soft close cabinets, quartz counters, cool modern faucet, zero radius undermount sink, stainless GAS 4 burner range with power burners and self cleaning oven, built in microwave, super quiet D/W, garbage disposal and large refrigerator. 
Fully redone travertine (floor to ceiling stone) bath with tub/shower, lots of storage under sink (2 large storage drawers). 
Amazing downtown views with morning sun in the living room/kitchen/dining area.
Exotic Brazilian cherry wood flooring (not laminate) throughout the unit. 
Recent double paned windows for energy efficiency. LR has a 12 foot wide glass wall to take in the views. Same view also from balcony. 
Large closet in bedroom and a hall closet also.
Cats ok, well behaved dogs considered as well.
The location: 
Walkscore 94, BikeScore 80, Transit Score 80, close to Laurel Village (3.5 blocks), California and Sacramentostreet shops, 3 blocks, Geary Street shops/restaurants, 1 block. Divisadero 4 blocks. JCC gym (really nice and affordable for what it is) is 3 blocks away. USF is walking distance, Trader Joe's 1.5 blocks away.  Target - 1Block, close to Laurel Village
Bus wise, you can be downtown in 15 minutes on the 38BX or the 31BX both of which make their final stop 1/2 block away and then go non stop to the Financial District. It's like having your own personal bus running every 5 minutes. The 1, 1BX , 38, 38L are very close as well.
The area is great and has good weather, not too much fog. Parking on the street is easy for SF.  
(Off street Parking available for $195/mo, or private garage for $250/mo)
Private Storage spaces available in building as well ($50)
Coin Op laundry with very nice machines is right downstairs.
