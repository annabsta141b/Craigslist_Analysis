Live in the Mission, near great restaurants, and walking distance to 24th street BART station. The bedroom is beautifully lit, with a large window, and the bedroom itself can fit a bed and a couch easily (roughly 400 sqft).
Use a full size kitchen, and have a in-unit washer dryer. This is a private bedroom and shared bath in a 4 bed house. You'd be living with 3 other working professionals in their mid-20s (all working in tech)!
The room's available now, and will definitely go soon-- contact us today for a showing!
