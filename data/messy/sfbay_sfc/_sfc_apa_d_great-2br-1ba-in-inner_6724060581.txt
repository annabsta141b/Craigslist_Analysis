Great  2BR/1BA in an Inner Richmond home. Floors are hardwood except in bath; heat is via gas wall heaters. Apartment is entered through a long hallway that could accommodate several very tall bookcases. The hallway leads to the living room which in turn connects to the kitchen. Large kitchen has space for a small dining arrangement, gas stove, skylight, and provides access to bath and both bedrooms. Bedrooms have armoires instead of closets. Mid-apartment bedroom has direct access to the bath. Back bedroom has two skylights, faces and provides access to the deck and yard. Bath has a shower stall with curtain.
Exclusive use deck is small but could accommodate chairs and modest table. Yard is split between the home's two apartments by a path. There is a large storage shed at the back of the yard. The yard's lawn and plants have been neglected; plant and garden enthusiasts could have a field day improving its appearance.
Building is half a block from the shopping and dining districts on both Clement and Geary streets. Walk Score is 94, Transit Score is 79. Bus lines 2, 23, 38 and 44 are within a block and it's two blocks to lines 1 and 31. Laundries very close by. Street parking only. No pets.
Tenant pays a one-time broker's fee.
