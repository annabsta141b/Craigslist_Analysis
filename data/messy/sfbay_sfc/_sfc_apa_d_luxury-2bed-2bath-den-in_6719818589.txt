Available for lease is a 1400sf 2bed, 2ba + den apt (unfurnished) in the NEMA building in SOMA -20th floor apt 2001. Corner facing with amazing views of the city and Civic Center.  I've lived at NEMA for over two years and love the building as it has all I could want in a community building. Great amenities, staff, technology, events and neighbors.
My family has to relocate and we are looking for someone to move in to our unit and start a new l2 mo lease. 
This building is perfect for employees of Uber (same block), Square (same block), Twitter (across the street) to name a few among many others within walking distance. There are plenty of their employees within the building too so you will be in good company to network and or collaborate. The building is also 1 block away from Muni and Bart stops.
