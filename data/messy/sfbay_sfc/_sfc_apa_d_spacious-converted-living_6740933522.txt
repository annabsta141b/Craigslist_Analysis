Hi!
I am looking to transfer my lease to a guy for a spacious unfurnished converted living space in a 1BR 1Bath apartment at 965 Sutter St, San Francisco, 94109 as soon as possible. The apartment is centrally located in downtown SF and is the perfect place if you want all the excitement to be near you (Excellent restaurants, bars, clubs - if that's your thing) but want a peaceful environment otherwise.
The Living Space: 
- Gives a studio feel and is pretty comfortable and huge (more than 12 x 12 feet)
- Rent: $1630/month + utilities (approx $50/mo). The space can also be shared by 2 people.
- The bedroom is occupied by a guy who works in the city with a software startup.
Amenities: 
- Laundry room 
- Gym 
- A nice patio with barbeque and fireplace for parties 
- Amazon Hub
- Security guard on duty post 6:00 pm 
- Guest parking on request 
- Pet-friendly building 
- An affordable and lovely breakfast place just below the apartment with great coffee!
The neighborhood:
- Located in Lower Nob Hill
