Location:
The Ingleside neighborhood sits in the southwestern section of San Francisco and like its close neighbors, its grounds were originally home to horse racing, roadhouses, and farms. But once the area reached its full potential after the 1906 earthquake, Ingleside became a quiet residential haven that still attracts homebuyers today.
Most of the homes here were built before 1940 and cover a range of architectural styles, with a majority being small- to medium-sized single-family homes. Residents here enjoy quaint Victorian cottages, Mediterranean Revival, and stucco-coated townhomes, as well as Spanish-style abodes.
Ocean Avenue stretches across the entire northern border of Ingleside, serving as the primary commercial strip. What residents can not find here, they can find in nearby neighborhoods -- which along with all of San Francisco -- are accessible by the public transportation lines that access Ingleside.
Notable businesses along Ocean Avenue are the Ingleside Community Center, providing a safe place for youth to study and receive tutoring, as well as the newly remodeled and polished Ingleside Branch Library, and a long-time favorite watering hole, The Ave Bar.
Ingleside is considered one of the more affordable residential neighborhoods in San Francisco. With its location being an amenity itself, with easy proximity to all of the city's offerings, its popularity is bounding, making it an even more alluring destination for homebuyers and renters alike.
