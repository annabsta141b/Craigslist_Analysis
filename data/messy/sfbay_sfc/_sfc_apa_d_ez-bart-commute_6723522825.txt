Looking for cool people to rent UPPER FLAT of triplex .
 It is 9 min. stroll from bedroom to ON the BART train. No parking, driving or car/bus hassles!!
 31 minute BART ride to SF.
 Two bedroom unit, wood paneling, cathedral ceiling old school charm with modern kitchen - dishwasher, disposal, new counter/lights.
 In unit washer/dryer, off street and street parking. Back deck surrounded by trees.
 Walk to Trader Joe's, post office and drug stores. Walk to reservoir and all downtown shops/restaurants/Safeway/Whole Paycheck.
 So to the PERSON that keeps flagging me, some of us can't afford SF; so an alternative with easy BART access to the city and sunshine is BETTER option. Please stop FLAGGING THIS AD 
May do partial trade for room rental in tenderloin or?
