THE LOCATION
=================================================================
It's a newly renovated two bedroom, one bath apartment with views of the Presideo. It has all the original wood trim details but with a new marble bathroom, and totally updated kitchen. High coved ceilings. Open floor plan. 
Within 15 steps from your front door you will be able to spend mornings and evenings on jogs or walks through the Presidio and Mountain Lake Park, entertain young children at the brand new play park, and play tennis with friends at the outdoor courts. 
The NOLA "North of Lake Street" district is a fabulous tree-line street with all the character you would expect from a high end San Francisco neighborhood, with mansions and Victorian buildings dotted along Lake Street this is an ideal setting to live 
in the bustling city. Popular Baker Beach is within a 10 minute jog and there is a dog park within 5 minute walk along Mountain Lake Park for you to spend your weekend end with your furry friend hiking and jogging through the Presidio or Golden Gate 
Bridge. The building is securely tucked away in the cul-de-sac of NOLA (North of Lake), a secluded neighborhood in between Sea Cliff and Presidio Heights. Right behind the cul-de-sac is the gorgeous backdrop of Mountain Lake which is the only natural lake in the Presidio and Mountain Lake Park - a beautiful tree lined park with plenty of grass and viewing opportunities. Inside the park are dual tennis courts, a children's playground, and running/hiking trails that extends through the Presidio. 
Other nearby neighborhoods and amenities include: Baker Beach, Marina, Golden Gate Bridge, Presidio Bowling, Presidio Golf, Presidio Park, and public transit (38 Geary or 1 California) that takes you all the way across town, into the Embarcadero and financial district.
