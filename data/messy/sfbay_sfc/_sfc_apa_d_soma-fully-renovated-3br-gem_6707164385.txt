(NEXT OPEN HOUSE is Wed Oct 17 6-7pm. Current tenants are in the midst of moving this weekend, so no showings until vacant.)  
This flat is in a lovely five unit Romeo-style apartment building on a quiet street in SoMa, fully remodeled to the studs in 2016. It's a 3-bedroom, one bath flat, with open kitchen/sitting room with breakfast bar. 
All new electrical, plumbing, insulation, walls, fixtures, etc. Sleek, quiet, efficient electric heating in each bedroom with separate thermostats. Brand new and cool bathroom with waterfall sink and tons of bathroom storage. New oak hardwood floors (no, not that Pergo sh*t you see all the time -- actual hardwood installed by an old Italian guy!). Washer/Dryer in the unit. All new cabinetry, granite kitchen. Dishwasher, garbage disposal. 
Plenty of hallway and bedroom closet space.
I live next door, so there is not a management company that comes when they want, and I care about the quality of the tenants because I live next to you!
It's small square-footage-wise, and each of the bedrooms is about the same size, making it better suited to roommates than to a couple looking for a larger master bedroom. But it's on Natoma between 7th & 8th in the heart of SoMa, 1.5 blocks from Civic Center BART/Muni, around the corner from hot restaurants, a block or two from SoMa clubs and nightlife, walkable to Metreon, City Hall, BART, CalTrain. All the tech company shuttle buses pass right by at 7th and Mission. On Street Parking, but walkable to Twitter, Zinga, Uber, Facebook, Google. 
Asking $4200. That's only $1400 a room, so a very good deal in SoMa.  Address is 618 Natoma Street #2, near 7th.  Available Oct 16. Email reply above or text  show contact info
