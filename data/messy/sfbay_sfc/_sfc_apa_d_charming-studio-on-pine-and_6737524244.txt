My lovely studio apartment needs to be rented out again. I am looking for someone that wants to live in a great area and love my apartment to make their own. The apartment is conveniently located near Fillmore and all the tech buses, google, facebook etc. Shopping and restaurants is near and I built a custom closet for someone that loves shoes and shopping. Please submit your credit report dated within the last month. We are looking for a 3 month deposit and move in ASAP.
