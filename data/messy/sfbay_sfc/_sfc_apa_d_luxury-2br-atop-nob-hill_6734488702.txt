NOB HILL NEIGHBORHOOD
Nob Hill is an affluent district, home to many of the city's upper-class families as well as a large 

young urban professional population.The Mark Hopkins Hotel and the Huntington Hotel are located 

one block away at Mason & California. The hotels were named for three of The Big Four, four 

entrepreneurs of the construction of the Central Pacific Railroad: Leland Stanford, Mark Hopkins & 

Collis P. Huntington. The fourth, Charles Crocker has a garage named after him in the neighborhood. 

The Fairmont is also named for a San Francisco tycoon, James G. Fair.Though Nob Hill is a very densely 

built neighborhood, there are parks at which residents and visitors can relax and enjoy the outdoors. The 

most prominent park in the neighborhood is Huntington Park, which takes up an entire block, bounded 

by Sacramento Street to the north, Taylor Street to the west, California Street to the south, and Cushman 

Street to the east. Huntington Park was formerly the site of the mansion of Central Pacific Railroad 

baron Collis P. Huntington; the mansion was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire, however, and 

Mr. Huntington's widow donated the property to the city to establish a park in 1915. Huntington 

Park has a playground for children, landscaping, and several fountains. Washington & Hyde Mini 

Park is situated on a single lot between two apartment buildings on the north side of Washington Street, 

between Hyde Street and Leavenworth Street. Washington & Hyde Mini Park has a playground for 

children, landscaping, and public restrooms.
