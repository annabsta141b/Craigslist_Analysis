Come home to all new. This apartment has just been renovated to feature brand new wood flooring, new stone countertops, and new stainless steel appliances. These new finishes complement the stunning and timeless features we love in this home, including the floor to ceiling windows, high ceilings, and large glass sliding doors to let you onto your private patio.
This massive two bedroom has been converted into a three bedroom with the professional installation of a flex wall in the living room. By adding this wall, we have created a spacious third bedroom while still providing a large living space and open concept kitchen in the home. This wall comes complete with a locking door, and is strong enough to mount a television onto. Nowhere else in SOMA will you find a three bedroom home with this square footage and low price point. Call today for more information!
