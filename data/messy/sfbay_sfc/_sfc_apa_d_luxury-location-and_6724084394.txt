One block from the Financial District, I-80, and the Bay Bridge, 388 Beale is just minutes from the Embarcadero, downtown San Francisco, Chinatown and ATT Park.
This one bedroom apartment has a large walk in closet, and a bedroom large enough to accommodate a California King sized mattress. In addition to the walk in closet, this home also has a laundry room that has been fitted with shelves to provide additional storage space. 
The restroom in this home attaches to the living area, which makes it an ideal space for entertaining guests. 
There is a private patio with a sliding glass door built into the floor-to-ceiling windows that line the living room. 
All of our homes have a private laundry washer and dryer in unit.
We are proud to be a pet friendly community!
We are able to provide leases as short as 31 days or as long as 15 months. We are also able to offer furnished, all-inclusive, leases upon request.
