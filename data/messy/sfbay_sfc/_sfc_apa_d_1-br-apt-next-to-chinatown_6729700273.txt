Location & POI Distances
This furnished rental is located in North Beach. It is full of rich Italian culture and is deemed the 'Little Italy of San Francisco'. Many trattorias, cafes and bakeries line Columbus Avenue and Washington Square. Located in the northeast, next to Chinatown and the Financial District, both tourists and locals love to spend time here. From independent book shops to lively nightclubs, North Beach offers a diverse array of entertainment options. The neighborhood is populated by a mix of young urban professionals, families and immigrants. Fisherman's Wharf is just a 10 minute walk away. 
Photos are from a similar property. Our interior decorating team is currently working on the furnishing. The furniture and equipment will look almost identical, but some differences in layout must be expected.
Building amenities may have an extra cost.
