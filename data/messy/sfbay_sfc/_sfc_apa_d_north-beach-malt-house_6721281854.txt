We loved living here!  We grew from a family of two to a family of four and enjoyed SF city life. Trader Joe's, Safeway, Walgreens, 24-hr fitness, shopping and more are within a 2-block radius.   DiMaggio Park, Washington Square Park, excellent restaurants and bars 3-5 blocks away.   
The North Beach Malt House is an historical landmark building, served as a malting factory for 40 years and it survived the 1906 earthquake!  Rebuilt and restructured into unique living spaces in the 2000's.
