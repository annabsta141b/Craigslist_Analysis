A spacious 1 bedroom, 1.5 bath at 1,187 square feet and a highly functional floor plan.  The main level consists of a remodeled kitchen, marble counters, half bathroom, and full walk-in closet.  Upstairs one will find a master bedroom, full bathroom, and a loft style office space. The apartment has all new appliances and washer/dryer inside the unit. 
 This building is designated as a landmark of historical significance.  Which also means it is located on bedrock and not landfill.  Re-habbed and retrofitted in 1996, this unit is a classic "Brick and Timber" loft with great style and architectural appeal.
The building is situated very well to restaurants, transit, and the downtown commercial district.  A short one block stroll and you will be on the Embarcadero where you will find a well-regarded Seafood restaurant and equally regarded steakhouse.  Across the street is a more casual dinning experience but the closest place to grab a meal.  If you walk another block down the Embarcadero towards the ferry building, you will find a fantastic neighborhood restaurant and bar.  And of course, there is always the Ferry Building itself, with multiple eateries and shops.  You are also a short stroll along the bay to AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants baseball team.
One block away on the Embarcadero is the Muni Tram system, which can take you to many places across the city.  A few blocks walk down Spear street toward Market street will take you to the Embarcadero BART station which can take you across the city and under the bay to east bay locations.
