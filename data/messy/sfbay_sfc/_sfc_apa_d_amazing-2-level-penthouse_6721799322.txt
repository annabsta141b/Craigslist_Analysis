Upper unit in a 2-unit building. Located on a quiet street - feels truly secluded and residential.
Recently renovated with amazing views of the bay and Coit tower. This modern home is filled with sunlight and superb aesthetics and is anchored by an open railed staircase which promotes a gallery-like setting for the viewer and is a piece of art in itself with the dramatic contrast of space and light.
