The open living space has 20+ foot ceilings, dining table for 6, a kitchen with all you need to cook and space to share with guests. Kitchen is equipped with a double stacked mini fridge, a mini freezer, convection/microwave oven, counter top hot plate, instant hot water maker, blender, and more. Sleeping loft is a walk up, has a full size bed (note ceiling height is not full standing height). The bathroom boasts an original claw foot tub.
