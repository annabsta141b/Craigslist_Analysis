Spacious Fully Furnished Home with Hot Tub
This 3 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom home is fully furnished and features recent renovations including solar panels, radiant floor heating, and a gorgeous chef's kitchen.

Lovely period details remain such as stained glass windows, built-in cabinetry, and fireplaces.
The open living and dining room is on the first level, which also features the third bedroom (great for use as an office or den), a half bathroom, and a deck with a barbecue, perfect for entertaining. On the top level, there are the master suite and two other rooms: one bedroom with a large north-facing window and gorgeous city view, and another enclosed room that could be a nursery, an office, or a den. There are two full bathrooms on the top level, one of them in the master suite.
