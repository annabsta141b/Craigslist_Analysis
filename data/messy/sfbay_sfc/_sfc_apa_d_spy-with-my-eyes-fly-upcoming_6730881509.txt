is not only looking great for being 111 years young, but we get to holler "FIRST!" what with being in this particular area of SoMa well before it was hip. Rocking a perfect 100 Transit Score, our primo location is...
a 7-minute walk from the 4th & King St. Cal-Train
a 17-minute walk from the Montgomery St. BART
a 6-minute walk from the MUNI's around the ballpark
a 2-5 minute walk from numerous bus lines
a 7-8 minute walk from two major supermarkets
Minutes from highways 80 & 280
All of that is just the tip of the housing-iceberg, as 574 3rd St. is just across the street from the sweet shops and lush scenery of South Park, one block from (supposedly) the best burritos in the City, and the perfect sweet-spot from bars and clubs (aka close enough to stumble home but far enough away to avoid the noise of excessive revelers).
So what are you waiting for, a roadmap? Please make an appointment and come on down and check out a unique, non-corporate hegemonic multi-family apartment community that you can proudly call home.

Back in 2015, # 105 was completely remodeled from top-to-bottom, left-to-right. EVERYTHING, from the wiring to the plumbing to the flush wall mounted heaters to the insulation to the quiet sheetrock, there was nary an object in apartment # 105 that wasn't updated or replaced.Facing east and on the receiving end of fabulous morning light that shines in from the noise-reducing vinyl windows, # 105 boasts hardwood and granite tile flooring, a granite counter top in a kitchen that features a gas stove and a matching granite dining nook. The bathrooms (that's right, ROOMS) consist of a  private privy with a ventilation system, a stand-up shower with a deep sink, and a sweet cherry medicine chest and cabinet. Rent ready on or around November 2nd, 2018.
