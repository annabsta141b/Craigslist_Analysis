Being able to get around easily is key, but what about when you come back home? When you come back home to SoMa Square you will be encompassed by an oasis-like, elevated central courtyard that is unlike any offering in SoMa. Get in a good workout in our updated fitness center or take a dip in our heated pool. We also have a rejuvenating spa for your pleasure.

Before you make a decision and before you make a move, you must have a look at our wonderful community.
