 When you come to a fork in the road, take it all the way to Duboce Triangle. Tucked between The Castro and the Haight, this tranquil oasis is at the crossroads -- and multiple MUNI lines make it easy to trek further afield. It's a bike commuter hub and dog-lovers' dream; its namesake park is always teeming with off-leash pooches.
