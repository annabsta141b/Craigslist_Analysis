This two-bedroom and two-bathroom condo unit is located in the Pacific Heights neighborhood in San Francisco. With excellent walk and transit scores of 88 and 91, respectively, this place is rated as very walkable so most errands can be accomplished on foot, and the transit is rated as world-class public transportation. An array of restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, pharmacies, bars, banks, bus stops, and parks are all within a seven-minute walking distance. It is also a thirty-minute walk or a six-minute drive to downtown San Francisco.  The unit itself features rich hardwood flooring and a private balcony--perfect for outdoor dining. The living room has minimalistic furniture that frees up space to an already spacious room. The kitchen features classic but stylish wooden cupboards and drawers, smooth granite countertops, and ready-to-use stainless steel appliances. Thanks to carefully-placed lighting fixtures and huge windows, the bedrooms are bright and sun-filled during the day and still well-lit at night. Parking for extra.
