Hi, 
We're looking for someone to join us on our lease in a top floor apartment (18th floor) in a 2b/2ba in Mission Bay. Ideal move in would be Saturday, Nov. 10. This space would have the best panoramic view in the entire apartment (looking over Mission Bay, the channel, city views and all the way out to the East Bay). You would be sharing bathrooms with one other person. The converted space is approximately 10x11ft. 
Location is amazing. The apartment is right in front of Caltrain (4th/King) and Muni stops so it's extremely convenient for commuting into South Bay or downtown. Additionally, there's a Safeway across the street. 
Apartment amenities include: In unit washer/dryer, dishwasher, ample counter space for the kitchen, parking (at additional cost). 
The apartment complex's amenities include an indoor basketball court, gyms, multiple courtyards to BBQ/have friends over, rooftop observatory deck that overlooks downtown, and more.

You would be living with 2 guys in their mid-20's who both work in finance @ tech companies. Please email us with your LinkedIn profile and quick bio about yourself.
