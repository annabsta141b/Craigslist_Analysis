Located near Golden Gate Park and in the Upper Haight, this lovely 1-bedroom/1bath ground floor apartment is newly-built. It features a large living room with skylights that has direct access to the backyard garden for indoor/outdoor living.
The kitchen has brand new appliances: dishwasher, refrigerator, microwave, gas stove, and stainless steel sink with garbage disposal. 
You'll also appreciate the beautiful oak floors and spacious walk-in bedroom closet. In fact, there is lots of storage throughout this unit. 
The full bathroom has both tub and shower and plenty of storage shelving. 
There is a washer and dryer on the premises.
Water, gas, garbage, and electricity are included.
This is a wonderful location for great weather and access to shopping and amenities. It is easy walking to restaurants on Haight Street and in Cole Valley.
Public transportation is one block away on Haight Street, and the MUNI street car runs close by at Carl and Cole Streets.  
You'll be close to UCSF Medical Center, USF and Golden Gate Park, but enjoy the quiet of our small apartment building in a tranquil neighborhood.
