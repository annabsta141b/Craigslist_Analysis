This is the best location to enjoy the more laid-back, beach-town quality, along with abundant outdoor opportunities. Just steps from your door, both Ocean Beach (great for kite flying, sun bathing, surfing, picnics..) and the Golden Gate Park (golfing, walking, exploring, relaxing..) are within easy reach. You can enjoy walking, hiking, and biking on the Lands End Trail, or head to Sutro Heights Park. After a vigorous day of recreation, stop by the iconic Cliff House for some Clam Chowder and gorgeous Sunsets, or head to Park and Beach Chalet for some casual dining. Several Muni bus lines serve the area, including the 38 Geary, the 5 Fulton, and the 31 Balboa.
