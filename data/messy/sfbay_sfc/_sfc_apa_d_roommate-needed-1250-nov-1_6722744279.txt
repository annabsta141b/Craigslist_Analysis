1 bedroom available with walk-in closet, with a shared kitchen and bathroom with one of best roommates you'll find.  Each tenant has basically their own little studio. Large enough for a bed, couch and other furniture. You can also keep my couch and coffee table, bed frame for $125. Couch is comfy, from ikea, could use a new cover, but not necessary. Bed frame has slots so just a mattress is needed if you don't have a box spring. 
8 min walk to Powell station, close to every bus line, union square 5 mins. In heart if it all. 
Move-in Date anywhere between Nov 1- Jan 1.  Preferably no later than Dec 1.  You will be taking over my lease through February, and then will be on a month to month agreement. 1500 security deposit, rent is 1250 plus internet and electric which comes to about $45/month at the most. Must complete an application, they will do a credit check and rent is paid automatically from one's bank account. 
We are looking for a super easy going, clean, respectful person late 20's early 40's.  If you're interested please reply with some times you'd like to come see it.
