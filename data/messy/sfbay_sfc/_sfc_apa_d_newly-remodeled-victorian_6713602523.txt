Looking for someone to enjoy a newly renovated grand pad in the heart of The Mission. Unassuming from the outside and intimately comfortable from the inside.  On the tree lined streets of 24th in The Mission, be where it's happening, yet away from it all as you walk upstairs to your custom flat with many period details and all of the modern comforts you would expect in a modern flat. It's configured as a one bedroom, but can easily accommodate a home office, additional bedroom space or more.
