Transit and the Neighborhood
The Shipyard is a fantastic neighborhood that is quiet and gorgeous and being newly developed on the old Shipyard Industrial area. Last large area of undeveloped land in SF.
Lots of Open Space
The sunniest weather in the city
Plenty of street parking, no meters
New park at top of street with panoramic views of Candlestick Point and the bay
15 minute walk to Heron's Head Park - my favorite run in city!
Short walk to a nature trail along the bay shore
Easy bike ride to Candlestick Point State Recreation Area
It is easy to take the Muni Bus to the T train and be in the nearby neighborhoods of Dogpatch, Bayview, or Potrero Hill
To downtown: SF 20-min. drive, 30-min. bike, or 50-min. public transport (almost around the clock). Bus #19 stop across the street, downtown SF in 50 minutes (or transfer at 3rd St. to MUNI T-Line, similar time to downtown).
