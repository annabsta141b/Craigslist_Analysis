Newly renovated, the unit has beautiful new oak floors, new lighting fixtures, and new custom interior and closet doors.

The second full bathroom and laundry alcove are also located on the main living level. The 3rd bedroom is located on the lower entry level, and can be used as an office. An inviting loft space is located above the main living area, and could be used as a 4th bedroom. The loft has a large walk-out deck space.
