Elegant, contemporary apartment off one of Telegraph Hill's stairway walks on a lush, secluded stretch at the end of one of San Francisco's otherwise key downtown streets. Just a heartbeat away from Coit Tower, the apartment's bay side commands an inimitable view of the Bay Bridge, Treasure Island, and the East Bay including Mt. Diablo. Living room, dining room, balcony and kitchen overlook the bay; the well-forested neighborhood fills the apartment's side and back with a lovely natural setting. Walk Score is 91, Transport Score is 95.
