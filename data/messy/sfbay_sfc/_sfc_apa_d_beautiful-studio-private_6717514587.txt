A peaceful 505sq ft apartment with private patio for rent in the Nob Hill/Downtown area. Inside, a most excellent layout offers 9-foot ceilings, cook-friendly kitchen and rock star closet space. Other rich details include mullioned windows, crown moldings and wood-burning fireplace. Designed by Beverly Willis, Nob Hill Court's 1973 building enjoys a dramatic two-story entrance with spiral staircase and inward-facing design centered around a quiet courtyard. This apartment is only 1 of 5 with an outdoor space. Apartment comes unfurnished. 
Photos are from staging when apartment was sold in April 2017. I have since redone the lighting to remove the track lighting, adding inset bucket lights with dimmers. 
Backyard has ample space for outdoor furniture, BBQ, and/or personal workout space. A true little hidden oasis.
