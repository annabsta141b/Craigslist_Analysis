take over my lease or sign your own!
I'm moving a few blocks away & am looking for someone to take over my affordable studio near civic center. Just up the street from the 31 & only minutes from the 5R and 38R that get you almost anywhere from this central location! hardwood floors, updated kitchen/bathroom, a walk-in closet and a second oversized closet which can fit a full size bed. perfect for someone looking for total privacy or a great solution for two people looking for semi-privacy. available move-in Nov 1st (slightly flexible depending on circumstances). message me for more info or to come see in person!
