Don't be obtuse -- Duboce Triangle has all the right angles. Easy MUNI and bike commute plus chill vibe and fun bar scene add up to a winning neighborhood. Play fetch with the four-legged locals at Duboce Park, win over the karaoke crowd at the Mint, and be a pinball legend at Brewcade. Bonus round: The Mission, Castro and Haight are all steps away.
