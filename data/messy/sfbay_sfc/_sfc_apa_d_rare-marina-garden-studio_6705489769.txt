For the first time in almost seven years, this cozy studio is available. Viewing is at your convenience. Short (at least 6 months) or long-term contract.
You have your own entrance off the street. The unit is in the back of the building and looks onto the garden/backyard. Access to the garden is right outside your front door. Feel free to barbecue! The unit gets morning sun. Within a couple of blocks in any direction you can reach the bustling Chestnut street where you have great restaurants and shops, or the tranquil Palace of Fine Arts or Crissy Field. If you happen to work downtown, the 30x stops right across the street.
