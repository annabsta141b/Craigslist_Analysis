i am renting a 1 bedroom unit in the mission district on woodward st. (off of 14th). now named "tamale alley" because the tamale lady lived across the street. there are six units in the building and yours will be a middle unit. you will be close to bart, muni and pretty much everything else. i love the street, it's fairly quiet and all of your neighbors and polite and considerate. the place was redone about 11 years ago and looks nice (generic but nice). we have a shared yard and utility room with free washing machines. it will be available december 1st.
about the unit:
- 1 bedroom, 1 bath about 500 sq feet.
- bedroom is carpet, main area is hardwood
- 2 closets and a built-in in by bedroom windows
- newer kitchen with dishwasher
about the building:
- shared back yard
- laundry room (free-not coin opp)
- room to keep your bike outside on the porch
terms:
- rent is $2,400 a month
- it is available december 1st with a 1 year lease
- security deposit of $2,4000 due upon signing
- you are responsible for pg&e
pros/cons
- the building just had a soft story retrofit. which means it's stronger for earthquakes.
- the building behind us is under construction. the good news is that your bedroom in the the front. if you work somewhat normal hours, this shouldn't be a problem
i'll be at the house on this sunday from 1-3pm. please contact me for address.
thanks
