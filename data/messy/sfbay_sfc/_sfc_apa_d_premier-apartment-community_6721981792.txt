You'll wake up every day surrounded by the beauty of award-winning landscaping--creeks, waterfalls, fountains, flowers, and trees. Work out at the state-of-the-art fitness center, play a little bocce ball on our all-weather court, practice golf at the putting green, soak in our Whirlpool spa, or simply relax by the resort-style pool. Enjoy the view from your oversized patio or balcony, then settle into the luxurious comfort of your apartment home with GE appliances, granite countertops, white cabinetry, in unit washer/dryer, extra-deep full-wall closets with mirrored doors, custom decorator blinds, new Milgard double-pane windows for energy efficiency and quiet, and much more. Centrally located near downtown Mountain View, the Apartment is close to fantastic shopping, restaurants, parks, and performing arts, and has easy access to Highways 85, 101, 237, and 280. Within walking distance you'll find groceries, Camino Medical Center, El Camino Road, and the Stevens Creek biking and jogging trails.
