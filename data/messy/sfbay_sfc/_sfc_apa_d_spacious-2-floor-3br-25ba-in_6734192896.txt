Welcome to 499 33rd Avenue, a spacious and sunny condo in the heart of San Francisco's beloved Richmond District. With relatively new construction (built in 2004), this thoughtfully laid out condo spans 2 floors, providing privacy to the 3 bedrooms (or home office) from the common living areas on the main floor. As you walk into the front door, you'll find a gourmet kitchen with a 6-burner gas range, oversized refrigerator, and granite countertops along with a designated dining area. Also on the main floor find a half bath, washer/dryer, and sunny living room featuring "top down bottom up shades" which allow you to control the lighting in the room--you'll love them!
Head upstairs to the master bedroom with its private full bathroom and two additional bedrooms and full bathroom. One of the bedrooms contains a custom-built Murphy Bed and cabinetry unit. Perfect for a home office, guest room, or regular bedroom. Other features you'll appreciate are the beautiful hardwood floors, gigabit internet, and in-unit laundry.
The building features a gorgeous lobby and secured garage--one parking spot is included plus 2 steel cabinets for extra storage in the garage. If you climb the stairs to the roof, you'll discover incredible 360 degree views, including those of Golden Gate Bridge. The location offers a peaceful respite from the city without comprising convenience and public transportation. Across the street, order pizza until 2am and just below the building find a convenience/liquor store. Many of the most beautiful natural locations are less than a mile away including: Golden Gate Park (watch the nearby famous bison or remote controlled model yachts/boats of Spreckels Lake!), Legion of Honor, China Beach, and Landsend Trail.
