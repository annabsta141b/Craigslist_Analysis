Welcome to Windsor at Dogpatch. Situated in the heart of the historic Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco, our community brings modern living to the storied streets and waterfront that launched a city. Our modern pet-friendly studio, one, two, and three-bedroom apartments are designed to accommodate all needs. Whether you are an ambitious professional or an innovative artist, you work-from-home or commute, whether you have a cheerful child or a faithful furry friend, we have an abode that's just right for you.
From a ditch-your-gym-membership fitness center with stretching room and a commercial kitchen-meets-bar-meets-resident lounge to a rooftop deck with bay and city views-we have amenities to keep you comfortable, inspired, and carefree. Not to mention the trendy in-home finishes such as the GE stainless-steel appliances and washer/dryer sets or the Google Fiber and Wave G internet. Some floor plans have private balconies or patios, so you can always be surrounded by  the sights and sounds of San Francisco.
Our location's convenient access to major roads like I-80, I-280, and US-101 and ideal location near the 23rd Street Muni Rail and 22nd Street Caltrain stops, brings you closer to anywhere you want to be. Nearby employers include UCSF, Kaiser Permanente and Pinterest. The neighborhood offers a myriad of restaurants, bars and coffee shops that are easily accessible. AT&T Park as well as Chase Center, soon to be home of the Golden State Warriors, are only a few of the many nearby attractions.
