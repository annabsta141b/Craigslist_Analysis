Hey All,
I am looking for a new roommate! The room is in a 2 bedroom efficiency in Portola Heights San Francisco directly across the street from McLaren park. Rent is $1100 and utilities are usually $50 per month. 
The room is available now October 12th or November 1st. It's a good size room in 2 bedroom apartment efficiency (not a full kitchen but two stove burner, toaster oven, microwave, and grill). You will have access to the full size kitchen upstairs in the main house as well. Amenities include hardwood floors, backyard, washer, and dryer, Mclaren Park, full size fridge, common area in the garage that we share with upstairs housemates.
Overall it's great place to live: plenty parking, good people, and central location. We are right off of the 101 and also literally right across the street from the 29 bus. There are amazing views of the city and the Bay from the house. Please reach out to me for more information and to see the place. The room is available now or November 1st. I am asking for a security deposit equal to one months rent. Happy house hunting! I look forward to hearing from you!
All the Best,
Sam
