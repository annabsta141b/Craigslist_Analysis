Available for rent is a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment in The Gantry in Dogpatch. I've lived in this apartment for 2.5 years with roommates, but the time has finally come to move into my girlfriend's place on the other side of the city. My roommate wants to explore getting his own place as well. So, in order to get out of our lease early, we are attempting to find new tenants to come in and sign a new lease with the building. We may be willing to throw in some of the furniture if interested.
The Unit:
- Modern 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment (Camber floor plan) with hardwood floors throughout. 
- Master suite has an attached private bathroom and large walk in closet
- Every room in the apartment has independent remote controlled climate control (including air conditioning!)
- Stainless steel appliances in kitchen. 
- Large windows with views of the Bay
- In-unit washer / dryer
The building:
- This is a newer building with great amenities including courtyards, a gym, rooftop, fire pits, grills, shuffleboard, and entertaining spaces. Package lockers on-site and secured bike storage as well. There is garage parking available for $300/mo, but there is also plenty of street parking. More details about the building here: https://www.thegantryapts.com/
The area:
- This is very much an up and coming area. The apartment is in a very central area, located just a 10 minute walk from 22nd Street Caltrain station, 3 minutes from 3rd street Muni stops, walking distance to great bars and restaurants, AT&T park, Mission Bay, and various gyms (3rd St Street Boxing, Dogpatch Boulders).
Availability:
- As soon as December 15th. Also open to January 15th if that works better for you.
Rent is $4755 per month. Shoot me a message if you're interested and we can discuss more details. If the posting is visible, then the apartment is still available (I will take it down as soon as it's taken).
