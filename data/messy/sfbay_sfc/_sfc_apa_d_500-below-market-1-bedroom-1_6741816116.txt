Email directly to me for more information. This is a sublease until end of July. Luckily I am locked in at a rate that is $500 dollars cheaper than the other same units in the building for new leases. If you decide to stay they can't raise your rent to market value. Great deal! I am leaving the area which is why I am wanting a sublease. I love this place. Pease reach out if any questions. Information is below. 
This is a 1 Bedroom, 1 Bath, approximately 573 Sq. Ft.
