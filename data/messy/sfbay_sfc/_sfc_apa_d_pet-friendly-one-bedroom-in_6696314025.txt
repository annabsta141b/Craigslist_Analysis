Lower Nob Hill is home to an abundance of great restaurants, cafes, bars, music venues, and shops, and this unit is within walking distance of them all. Catch a show at the Great American Music Hall, have a fun sushi experience at Ryoko's, shop in Union Square, have a drink at bourbon and Branch, or grab some fresh pastries from Jane. Whatever you decide, you will not be far from home. If you do wish to step out of the neighborhood for awhile, your just a fifteen minute walk away from Powell or Civic Center BART stations, and buses are all around.
Rate for first month only. Furnished apartment for short term rental.
