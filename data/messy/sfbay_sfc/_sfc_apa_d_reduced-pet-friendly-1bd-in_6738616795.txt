We're moving out of our 1bd at 1010 Potrero and it's vacant for move-in mid November.  It's really a beautiful apartment; it's on the top floor, facing downtown, and is ~730 sq ft.  It's 1 block to tech shuttles, walking distance to Dogpatch companies, and only ~15 min walk to King St & 22nd St Caltrain stations.  The building opened in 2016 and is full of amenities:Washer/Dryer in-unit
Daggett Plaza with an enclosed dog park
Roof deck with heated seats and Viking grills
2 common spaces with free wifi, pool tables, and community kitchens for hosting events
A pet spa for bathing & grooming
Secured bike room for no additional fee
A massive gym with a separate cardio and weight room
Covered parking [additional fee]
Package room managed by Luxe

The building has a Boba Guys, Potrero Hill Dental, Simply Mediterranean, and a Street Taco & Pilates studio opening in a few months.  It's literally a few blocks from amazing new restaurants and bars [Plow, Dumpling Time, School Night] and will be right down the street from the new Warriors stadium.  With our referral, our unit will currently be offered at $3.4k which is below market.  Message soon if you're interested because price may increase based on building demand.
