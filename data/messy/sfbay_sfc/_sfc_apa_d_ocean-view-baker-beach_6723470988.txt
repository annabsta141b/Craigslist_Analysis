This apartment overlooks Baker Beach with ocean views and is surrounded by lush greenery and cypress trees.  The sunset from your living room couch is breathtaking with a view of point Bonita Lighthouse.  It's a wonderful two bedroom apartment, one bath, with nice kitchen.  My wife and I have lived in the apartment for 4 years and we love it.  You can hear ocean waves crashing at night from bed, there's owls and wildlife all around... AND it's 10 minutes from the Marina, Union Street, and the Avenues.  The apartment has the option for you to have in-unit washer/dryer.  It's an awesome set up. Parking + Storage unit + Disheasher!  Rent is $3255 + utilities (~$90/month).  Must pass credit and background check.
