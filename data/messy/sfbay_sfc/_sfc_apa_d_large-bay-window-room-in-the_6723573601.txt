Hello All! 1 room in a 4 bedroom apartment in the Mission near 24th street.  The room is available starting November 1st and is in a prime location in the Mission. The room is great! It is a really big space, with huge bay windows that let in tons of beautiful, natural light. The house is rent controlled and probably the cheapest rent you can get in the Mission. The house is filled with 3 quiet and polite roommates and we are looking for a 4th. If you are interested please email with a short description of yourself and your living style. The room can come fully furnished if you would like for $300.00. 
Thank you!
