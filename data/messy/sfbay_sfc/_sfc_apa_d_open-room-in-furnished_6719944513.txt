2 blocks from UCSF Parn. - Open Room in Furnished Apartment. $1,550 includes ALL utilities!
hi!
my roommate is moving out of the city so the other room in my apartment is opening up.
-2 bedroom/1 bathroom
-very Inner Sunset - next to UCSF (literally just 2 blocks away) and Golden Gate Park 
-$1,550 includes ALL utilities - one price for everything!
I've been here for over 5 years, and the apartment is in a great, safe location - I live right on the "downtown" of the Inner Sunset. Tons of restaurants, bars, grocery stores and shops right outside our door. Balcony in the living room. Apartment and kitchen are fully furnished (minus the open bedroom.)
Right on All Public Transportation: 
1 block from Muni Metro (N Judah lightrail) that takes you downtown and 1 block from all major Muni bus transfers.
My only asks: No drugs, weapons, pets or large parties in the apartment.
If you are interested you are more than welcome to stop by and check it out in person. Please contact me to set up a time and also please tell me about yourself. 
The room itself is a pretty good size, has a window, and a two-sliding-mirror door closet for lots of storage/clothing. Additional limited storage is also available in the shared garage. Washer and dryer is also available onsite in the shared garage. 
I'm a 31 year old M professional, Bay Area Native. I'm a social, chill guy that loves exploring the city.
