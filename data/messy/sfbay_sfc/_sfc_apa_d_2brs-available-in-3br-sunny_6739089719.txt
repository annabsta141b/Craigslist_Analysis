Hi there! -- we have two bedrooms opening up in our large 3 BR sunny, quiet, dogpatch apartment.
We've been three guys here for the past few years and two of the roommates are now leaving the state.  
Here are the details:
Available:
Large BR w/ private bath - $1750
Medium BR w/ shared bath - $1650
Both are available December 1st or December 15th
Month to month lease w/ 30 day notice
The rooms are pretty similar:
- large
- sunny
- large closet
- both furnished with queen bed, night tables, and dresser (but we can remove furniture if you don't want it)
The apt:
- 3 br, 2 bath
- large living room and kitchen
- furnished (but with plenty of room for you to add things to living room if you have em!)
- wash/dryer in building
- street parking available
- some garage storage available
- in dead-end block -- so very quiet, no traffic
The roommates:
- I'm venezuelan/american working in data science and human genome stuff.  I try to surf a few times a week.
- Previous roommates have been guys but open to really anyone.  As long as we are respectful, clean and organized - I'm good. 
One hard requirement is that apt. is non-smoking.
The hood:
- The dogpatch. It's amazing. It's a hidden gem in SF. 10 degrees warmer than the rest of the city. Always sunny. The brooklyn of SF. Workshops, gourmet ice cream, breweries, amazing restaurants, and 2 blocks from 22nd st. caltrain station and muni.
Sublet Rent:
Large room: $1750/month + ⅓ utilities for private bath
Medium room: $1650/month + ⅓ utilities for shared bath
We ask for a 1.5 month security deposit which is what we pay to building manager as well.
Utilities we pay for are: high speed internet, gas, electric, water, garbage - the normal stuff.
To come see it:
Please send us some info about yourself and what you are doing in SF.  A LinkedIn profile or something showing that you are a working human able to pay rent will really help!
Please indicate in email subject if you want large or medium room. 
We'll then get back to you and figure out a time for you to come see it.
Cheers!
