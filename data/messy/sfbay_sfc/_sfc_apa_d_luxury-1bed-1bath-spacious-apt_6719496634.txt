Available for sublease is a 750sf Junior One Bedroom apt in the NEMA building in SOMA. Unit is available till March 31st 2019 with the option to extend. I've lived at NEMA for a year and a half and loved the building to bits as it has all I could want in a community building. Great amenities, staff, technology, events and neighbors.
I have to leave the city for an extended period and would like to retain my lease by subletting the unit to someone that can appreciate and enjoy it in the meanwhile. I expect to be away for about 6-9 months but you'd only be obligated to 5 months (till end of March) with the option to extend should you wish to.
This building is perfect for employees of Uber (same block), Square (same block), Twitter (across the street) to name a few among many others within walking distance. There are plenty of their employees within the building too so you will be in good company to network and or collaborate.
The sublease length is negotiable as I understand everyone may have different circumstances and thus am open to mutually viable options. The unit is generally available unfurnished, however if you're interested in the furnishing as is you are welcome to purchase it from me (at fair market value) or you can rent it for the duration of your stay. I will be selling all furniture I can easily replace or too cumbersome to move with so feel free to request a link to my listings should you be interested.
