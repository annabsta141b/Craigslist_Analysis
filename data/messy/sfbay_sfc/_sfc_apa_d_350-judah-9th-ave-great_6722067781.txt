 Bonfires at Ocean Beach, dumplings on Irving, picnics in Golden Gate Park -- these are a few of your favorite things when you live that Sunset life. This foggy enclave of SF natives, surfers and university students is a down-to-earth district with plenty of outdoorsy appeal. The Sunset has all the diverse dining and cocktailing options of more central districts, with the convenience of quieter living.
