Open house tonight from 6:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. Located at 3333 Broderick Street. This is the large studio floor plan with the huge walk-in closet that can be used as a bedroom.  Centrally located and walking distance to the Marina and shops - walking score is 88. Your new apartment has lots of light from the windows. The unit is airy and sunny. And there are beautiful hardwood floors throughout. You'll enjoy old San Francisco style living with the high coved ceilings, and a large, separate kitchen that includes its own eat-in area. There are some modern upgrades such as a dishwasher and granite counter tops, etc. But we've managed to still maintain much of the ambiance of this 1920's era apartment (some of the old kitchen cabinets, original hardwood floors, bathroom floor tiles, etc. still exist). This is a beautifully maintained building. There is also an on-site laundry facility for your convenience. This is one of the most highly sought after buildings in the Marina. Security deposit is only $2,500. Rent  includes water and garbage. No pets!
