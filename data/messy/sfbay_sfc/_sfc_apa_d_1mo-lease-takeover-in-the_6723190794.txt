Hey everyone!
I have a lease that ends on November 25th, but I need to move out before November 1st. The building is really centrally located (right across the street from the civic center and Bill Graham Auditorium! The rooftop has an amazing view of the city and the Civic Center Plaza (I watched Metallica from there for free during the recent Dreamforce concert). There is also a gym in the building. The apartment is a junior 1Bedroom (i.e. the bedroom doesn't have a window and it has a sliding door), it has in-unit Washer/Dryer, gas range and wood floors everywhere except the bedroom, which is carpeted. I am planning on selling the couch, the bed, and a table, so it can also be partly furnished! The apartment also has gigabit internet that I already paid for the whole year for, so you get it for free!
The price is pro-rated for the actual amount of time that someone would be in the unit, based on my monthly rent of $2935 (i.e. 25/ show contact info
).
There is an option to extend the lease at a higher price (dictated by the building) of $3025 after November 25 or move out then.
