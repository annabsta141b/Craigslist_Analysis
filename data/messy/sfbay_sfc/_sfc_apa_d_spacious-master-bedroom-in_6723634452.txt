Hi! My roommate and I are looking for a 3rd person to fill the master bedroom (with private bathroom) in our apartment at Bayside Village in South Beach. We're both guys in our early 20's and both work in finance.
The bed in the picture is a queen mattress for sizing reference. Everything in the room will be cleared out. We also have a cleaner that comes once a month to clean bathrooms/kitchen.
Ideal move-in period would be early/mid December. Message me if you'd like to see the place and please attach a Linkedin or FB profile. Thanks!
