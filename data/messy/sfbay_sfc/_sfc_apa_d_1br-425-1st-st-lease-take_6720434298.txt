Highly Touted Condo with Expansive Bay Bridge Views
This classic and highly touted 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom 07 floor plan with a glass-enclosed balcony on the 17th floor of One Rincon Hill provides one-of-kind panoramic views of both the downtown city skyline and Bay Bridge. Majestic, stunning views are showcased like artwork through its floor-to-ceiling insulated glass windows. Two unchallenged corner views define your exceptional living at One Rincon Hill. The home is available either furnished or unfurnished.
As one of the most popular floor plans at One Rincon Hill's Tower One, this generous open floor plan features a northeast corner location that gives the best of both worlds with a walk-in closet, a spacious inset balcony, and a view that gives a sense of living above it all. Expansive views of city landmarks include the Golden Gate Bridge, the Marin Headlands, Alcatraz, and the Bay Bridge. In-unit laundry and valet parking complete the home, which is available for a 1-year lease term.
The One Rincon Hill development is a late-modernist style high-rise condo tower designed by architectural firm Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates. One Rincon Hill soars to 60 stories and offers unparalleled vistas of the entire city of San Francisco. Ultra-luxury amenities such as a 24-hour doorman, a concierge, full service valet parking, a club-quality professionally equipped fitness center with steam rooms and showers, a full-size outdoor pool with a beautifully landscaped garden deck and large open grass area, a gourmet barbecue area with plenty of table seating to enjoy an afternoon lunch or dinner, and a reflecting pool with an infinity edge set One Rincon Hill apart.
Perched dramatically on the top of Rincon Hill, next to South Beach and Financial District and blocks from the Bay Bridge, Highways 101, 280, BART, and Caltrain, One Rincon Hill's prime location provides easy access to downtown, East Bay, and the Peninsula.
