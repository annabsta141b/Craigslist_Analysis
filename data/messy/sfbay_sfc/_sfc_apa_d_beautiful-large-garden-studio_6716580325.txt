(This is really a studio, but is listed as a one-bedroom as it is larger than most one-bedrooms at 750 square feet).
This garden unit was constructed as new in 2000, and this is just the third time it's been vacant since. Sure, it's a studio, but it's big. About 750 square feet (or 70 square meters for you Europeans). It features a completely open layout, spanning the complete width of the 25-foot wide building. French doors lead out to the private rear yard.
Bullet points are easier, you say?
 -	Dramatic open layout
 -	Dishwasher
 -	Washer & dryer in the unit
 -	Garbage disposal
 -	Walk-in closet
 -	Extremely quiet
 -	Private backyard
 -	Ground floor flat in three-story building
 -	Overall immaculate condition
As for the neighborhood, this is Duboce Triangle. Those in the know just adore this little three-sided slice in the middle of the city. It has a small-neighborhood feeling despite being spitting distance from one of S.F.'s main transit arteries (Market Street). The MUNI subway line is 1.5 blocks away, the F streetcar line even closer (it is a dream commute to the financial district). BART is seven blocks away, as is freeway access. Most, if not all, Silicon Valley buses stop nearby. It's technically part of the Castro, though the Mission and Lower Haight are just a few blocks away. Cafes, shops, restaurants, nightlife, banks, Whole Foods, Safeway, and more are just steps away.
Some minor downsides...
 -	This unit offers street parking only. Parking here is nowhere near as bad as Russian Hill or North Beach. Street parking is easy during the day on weekdays. If you commute home from work each weeknight after 7pm, you might find it annoying.
 -	It is a ground floor unit, with large windows and doors facing north. Natural light consists of ambient light only.
 -	Sorry, no dogs, but possibly a cat.
I'll be showing the place by appointment only starting Monday, October 8th. Shoot me an email, preferably with some info about yourself.
