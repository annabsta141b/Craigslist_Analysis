We have a 2 bedroom 1.5 bath townhouse near city college. 
The monthly rate includes utilities, cable and wifi.
The bedrooms are cozy but 4 students or family of 4 can live in this place comfortably.
the apartment becomes available on the 21st of October. You can secure this apartment for 30 nights or  secure a 1 year rental lease. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.
We manage several properties in San Francisco that may serve your needs if this property or location do not work out for you.
Thank you,
Jesse Arguello
