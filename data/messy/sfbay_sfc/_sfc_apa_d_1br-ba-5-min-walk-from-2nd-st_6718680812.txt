Location & POI Distances
This furnished apartment is located in the fast-growing neighborhood of Rincon Hill. One of the primary appeals of the area is its close proximity to downtown offices, public transit (BART), shopping and dining. A walk along the waterfront on the Embarcadero and the Bay Bridge is just one of the routes that Rincon Hill invites you to explore on foot. A must-do Saturday morning activity is a walk down to the Farmer's Market near the Ferry Building. Emerald Park is also in close distance.  2nd St & Harrison St Station is only 5 minutes away.
Building amenities may have an extra cost.
