Great studio apartment in the Mission District. Plenty of light and lots of closet space. Hardwood floors. Updated kitchen. Parking available in building for an additional fee. Unit located on top floor.
The building is located on 21st Street between Mission and Valencia Streets. It is a very short distance from the business and restaurant lined streets of the neighborhoods it surrounds - such as 24th Street, Mission Street, Valencia Corridor, and Church Street. The building is conveniently located within walking distance to public transportation, as well as close to freeway access to Silicon Valley and the East Bay. Enjoy Dolores Park, just a few blocks away. 
Rent is $2250. No pets, no smoking, one year lease. Available now.
