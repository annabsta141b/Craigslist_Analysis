Welcome to the Mission - Dolores Park is the Mission's heart - on a sunny day, bring a picnic and take in the unbeatable views of the San Francisco skyline and the bay beyond. 
In terms of cuisine, the Mission might very well be the richest neighborhood in a city already obsessed with food, but the Mexican cuisine is outstanding. Don't pass up La Taqueria, a 50-year-old San Francisco institution that practically invented the local taco and burrito styles, along with others like El Farolito. Try the taco dorado, a freshly deep-fried taco shell wrapped in a soft corn tortilla and filled with your choice of meat (we recommend the carnitas - deep-fried pork) and all the fixins. Public transportation - BART and MUNI are within walking distance.
