Hi Everybody!
I'm looking to fill my room in our cozy Central Richmond apartment starting on November 1st. It's a 3-bedroom apartment with two other girls (one Brazilian, one American) living here in their mid-20's. The room is spacious with hardwood floors and is unfurnished. We are looking for a relaxed guy or girl who is independent and easy to live with. Everyone living here operates on their own schedule, but are respectful and work together to make the home a nice place to live. The room is month-to-month with a security deposit of $1,150.
Please email me if you're interested!
Thanks,
Paula :)
