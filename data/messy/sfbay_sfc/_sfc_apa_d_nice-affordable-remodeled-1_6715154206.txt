Description
  
    This is a beautiful remodeled one bedroom apartment.  Everything was gutted and completely replaced - new walls, wiring, cabinets, bathroom, etc. The building is located on the corner of Jackson and Taylor streets in the prime part of upper Nob Hill and only one block south of Russian Hill.  It is ideal for walking to work, and only 5 blocks to North Beach.
I have owned the building for about 20 years during which time I have totally remodeled almost everything, including most of the apartments, all of the common areas including the basement, etc.  There have been very substantial upgrades for seismic safety, restoration of beautiful original plaster molding, restoration of hardwood floors in the entry, new lighting, etc.
The unit for rent is on the second floor of the building.  The kitchen is completely new with all new appliances, granite tops, pear laminate cabinets and a very nice new floor.  There are disposal, dishwasher, refrigerator, built in microwave and gas range.  Everything is relatively new.
The bathroom is also totally new as well.  The tile extends to the ceiling.  There is a large wall mirror.  All of the plumbing has been upgraded with new drains and copper water supply pipes.  All of the fixtures in the bathrooms are new.
The unit has hardwood floors, double glazed new windows and energy efficient lighting throughout.  All of the walls are fully insulated to reduce your heating costs and make the unit more comfortable.  All of the wiring throughout the unit is new and there are tons of electric plugs everywhere.
I have a relatively new laundry in the basement which has two energy and water efficient Neptune (Maytag) washers and two Neptune driers. The basement is quite an attractive part of the building, unlike most others in San Francisco.
I have one parking spot available for $350 per month. I also have one other view unit in the same building that is priced at $3,095. That unit has stainless appliances and is very nice.
I do not accept pets or smokers.  Sorry.
Best way to get in touch with me is to call my mobile phone or email me. 
Thanks for your interest.
