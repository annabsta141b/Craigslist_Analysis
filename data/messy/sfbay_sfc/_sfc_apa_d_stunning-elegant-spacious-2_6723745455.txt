Visit San Francisco and stay in our stunning, panoramic view apartment, in San Francisco's wonderful Pacific Heights neighborhood. Located in San Francisco's vibrant neighborhood of Cow Hollow, 1856 Green, No. 4 is walking distance to a shoppers' paradise on Union Street and one block from Restaurant Row. In a sunny neighborhood in San Francisco, the property is nestled on an elegant and quiet residential street in Pacific Heights, in the same block author, Amy Tan, lived early in her career, walking distance to everything.
The sweeping views from the large living room and dining room offer dramatic views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Francisco Bay and are perhaps the highlight of this spacious two bedroom property. The newly renovated apartment, (to sleep six), has an architect's touch, and includes a gracious living room and fireplace with flat screen TV, (and new sofa bed); formal dining room; brand new, complete kitchen, with Wedgewood china, Dansk flatware, Dansk pots and pans, designed by Quistgaard; two bedrooms with Ralph Lauren linens, new mattresses; oriental carpets; great artwork; two new baths; and a private laundry.
The apartment has access to a shared backyard, and a wonderful, producing Meyer lemon tree. In the tradition of Alice Waters and Chez Panisse, you can pick your own lemons and make your own dressing, for a world class salad with greens from Northern California farms.
Our location is within walking distance of Pacific Heights restaurants, and amazing shopping, as well as coffee shops, local restaurants and bars, galleries, museums, parks, and churches. We are one block from Union Square.
