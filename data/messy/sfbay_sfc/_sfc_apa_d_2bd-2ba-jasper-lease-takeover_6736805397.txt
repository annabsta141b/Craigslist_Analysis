Looking to move out of our 2bd/2ba unit at the Jasper -- we secured a rate that is about $1,500 less per month than other units in the building and you'll be able to get the same rate if we transition over the lease to you :)
You also get valet parking for $200/month instead of the usual $450/mo they charge incoming tenants.
 There's a master bedroom with it's own bath and the other bedroom with a separate bath.
Move in Dec 1st, lease ends March 26th and you'll be able to renew then - they don't increase rent by more than 1-3% if you continue the lease. When we renewed ours didn't change at all.
