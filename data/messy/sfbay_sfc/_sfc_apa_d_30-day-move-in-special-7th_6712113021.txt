NEIGHBORHOOD: INNER SUNSET 
Just steps away from Golden Gate Park; the Haight Ashbury and Cole Valley neighborhoods; and University of California, San Francisco. Easy access to numerous Muni light-rail and bus lines makes for convenient commuting to downtown. The University of California, San Francisco medical campus is located atop the hill on Parnassus Avenue. The bustling area around 9th Avenue and Irving Street has become one of San Francisco's most vibrant commercial districts. Home to unpretentious diners and cafes, upscale eateries, yoga studios, and even a magic shop, the eclectic neighborhood has something for everybody.
Bordering the Inner Sunset to the north, Golden Gate Park offers hiking and walking paths, bicycling, lovely gardens, and world-class museums. University of California, San Francisco's Mount Sutro Open Space Preserve has a few short but exhilarating paths through native trees and grasses. Pocket-sized Grand View Park provides views of downtown, Golden Gate Park, the Pacific Ocean, and the Marin Headlands.
