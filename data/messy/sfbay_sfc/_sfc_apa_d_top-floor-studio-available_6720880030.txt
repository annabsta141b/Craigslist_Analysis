I recently moved into this apartment and got transfered for my job and am looking to find someone to sign a new lease. 
The building is at the corner or Leavenworth and Geary. Tons of bars and restaurants nearby (98 Walkscore!). Easy walk to Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and 2 Bart stops!
The unit is a studio on the top floor and on the corner, so it has AMAZING views and light. 2 closets (one walk in), with a kitchen and bathroom. There is a washer and dryer in the basement.
If you are interested, shoot me an email and I can set up a time to show you the place. You can move in whenever you'd like. I also have some furniture that I am trying to get rid of if you need anything. I have a video that I took when I first moved in that I can send you to show you the space.
