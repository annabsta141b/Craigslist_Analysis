This is a classic upper corner 4 room flat (kitchen, bedroom, living room, and dining room).  The unit can easily be used as a true 1-bedroom with a formal dining room and living room.  It can also be used as a 2-bedroom with a living/dining room.  It has beautiful hardwood floors throughout and the kitchen is equipped with a gas stove/oven, dishwasher, garbage disposal, and fridge.  There are hookups for washer and dryer within the unit.  The bathroom is generous in size and the shower is over the tub. There is lots of storage space throughout the unit, the lighting is recessed on dimmer switches and the heat is a thermostatically controlled central furnace.
Included in the price is a single car private garage.  This is great to be used as a general storage space as well.
There is no smoking allowed in the unit and there are no pets allowed in the unit as well.
You are walking distance from great Richmond district restaurants (Tommy's, Ton Kiang, Violets, Fiorella, Pizzetta 211, Pearl, Angelinas, etc.) and the transportation set up is great with multiple muni lines very nearby (38, 31, 5, 2, 1, and express lines).
