Hello!
Looking for a roommate to move in by November 1st, 2018. We're located in a great location with shops/restaurants/transit nearby.
We have a moderate sized private unfurnished bedroom available in a 4 bedroom/ 1 bathroom apartment on Divisadero St./Pine St. The room also shares a small half bath with another roommate (just a sink with some extra space for your toiletries - see pictures)
Kitchen with dish washer and stove - Storage room with washer and dryer. Everything is in great condition and there is a ton of space. Cleanliness is also important to us!
There are currently 3 guys mid to late 20's living in the unit - all fully employed and graduated college. Two work in SF and one works in South San Francisco. We're looking for somebody mature and somebody we can trust. We're all very friendly, easygoing and conscientious about everyone's space. 
Please contact me (call/text/email) for more info and to schedule a viewing. Try to shoot me some information about yourself (age/job/hobbies/etc..) if you can. 
My name is John.  show contact info
 or email:  show contact info
. Thanks!
