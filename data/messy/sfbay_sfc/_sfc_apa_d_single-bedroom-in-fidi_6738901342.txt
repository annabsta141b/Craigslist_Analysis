We have an opening in our place in the FiDi starting December!
INFO:
We're looking for a fun roommate to move into a single bedroom in our two story, 4BR, 2.5BA townhouse in the heart of the Financial District! Move-in date would be December 1.
THE ROOM:
Spacious room with large closets and full-length mirrors for closet doors. 
LOCATION:
The location is incredible - it's on top of a Safeway and Starbucks, right next to Embarcadero Center and Bart Station, across the street from the Ferry Building, and walking distance from great stores/restaurants in North Beach, FiDi, and Chinatown.
AMENITIES:
In-unit laundry, tons of storage, a front & back patio, and roof access to panoramic views of SF!
You'd be living with 4 women in their mid-twenties in Tech, Consulting, and school - and 1 very nice kitty!
Please contact me!
