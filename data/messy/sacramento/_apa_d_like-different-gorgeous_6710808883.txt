. Sorry, no pets (you know how they bark and howl so, and smell up the carpets. We can't have you put up with that!). One year lease, we pay for your utilities other than the electricity and gas you use. $1975/month, 1500 sq ft, the greatest bargain in Sacramento, you'll agree when you see it! Plus, 1/4 mile to I-5, Downtown is then 4 minutes away. The address is 6016 S. Land Park Dr, 95822.  One year lease, then month to month. This is the Best! You will Love it!
