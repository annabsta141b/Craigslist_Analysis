Looking to fill our third bedroom of our 3 bed/1 bath apartment located in the heart of midtown!
We are two young working professionals with full time jobs hoping to find a roommate with a similar schedule to that. Pretty clean and organized during the week but like to let loose on the weekends. Preferably a girl candidate as that worked well in our previous home dynamic. If you think you'd be a great fit please reach out with a brief bio of yourself, a link to facebook if possible, and we will set up a time to chat! :)
Please:
- No pets
- No smoking
Amenities:
-Private Room
- Wifi
- Laundry onsite (walkable from apt)
- Lot parking in the back/street in the front 
- Central AC
- Utilities (we split 3 ways, roughly 50-60/month for each person)
This will be a month to month lease so therefore if it does not work out there's no strings attached!
* Pictures of the apt/room are provided upon request
