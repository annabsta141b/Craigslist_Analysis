Don't just take it from us, read what one of our satisfied residents has to say about life here at Riverfront- 
I LIVE IN PEACE AND QUIET... 
"I like living at Riverfront because it offers amenities and services I haven't found elsewhere. I have a reserved parking space, the three laundry facilities are handy and very clean and the community room is outstanding. I also appreciate the fact that the owners reside on premises as well as many of the staff. 
Appliance replacements or any repairs are timely. The staff is professional, courteous and caring and I trust them in my unit when I am not there. In this gated community, as a senior citizen, I feel safe walking the grounds or enjoying the pool. 
The buildings and facilities are kept very clean and the gardens and grounds are beautiful. I live in peace and quiet and enjoy visiting with new friends I have made here. I really don't consider that I live in a rental complex. Riverfront is my home."
