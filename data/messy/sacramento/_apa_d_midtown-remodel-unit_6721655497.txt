Newly remodeled one bedroom apartment.  New bathroom, title, tub, new vanity.  All new A/C and heater, new shutters.  New kitchen with all new cabinets and new GE apartment series appliances.  Ice maker, disposal and dishwasher.  Shared laundry room with washer and dryer on same floor.  Community backyard and garden.  Walkable to J Street restaurants and coffee shops but far enough away with no noise.  Close to parks.   Good street parking with no meters or permits.  Current tenant moving to two bedroom unit so November 1st move in date is flexible right now but good guestimation etc..  Basement not part of lease.
Please be careful of duplicate advertisements with below market rents.  Today i showed a gentlemen the apartment who thought the rent was $480/mo.  That is a scam and Craigslist has been notified.
