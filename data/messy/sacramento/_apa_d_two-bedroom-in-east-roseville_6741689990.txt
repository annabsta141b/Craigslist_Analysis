Relax with friends at the resort-style pool with its expansive sunning area, outdoor grilling kitchen and granite topped bar. When you do head out, Highway 80 is just minutes away. We are close to malls, shopping, restaurants and entertainment and Folsom Lake, with boating, fishing, picnicking and hiking opportunities, is only a short drive. Rosemeade is also located in the highly rated Eureka School District and Granite Bay High School boundaries. Pick up the phone, send us an email, or just stop by for a tour. Our attentive staff would love to help you find your new apartment home. Your smile is our reward!
