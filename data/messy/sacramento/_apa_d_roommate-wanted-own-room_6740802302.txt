Hello!
Reducing rent for a quick move in. I need someone ASAP
I'm renting a room in my 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment. I live off of Howe and American River Drive.
The apartment is the Island Lake floorplan. It comes with a dishwasher, fireplace, electric stoves, large closets (5 total) large wrap around yard, private patio, large windows, wet bar & kitchen bar. located right next to a pool with a bbq area right outside. it never gets used so it's always extremely quiet. Two covered parking spots.
its approximately 1100 sqft inside. mostly fully furnished except what would be your room. You'll have your own full bathroom with a bath tub. living room and kitchen are shared space.
I have a dog so you must be pet friendly.
Rent is $750 
Smud is depending on usage. 
xfinity wifi is $50. 
deposit is $400.
Available immediately. Rent will be prorated.
