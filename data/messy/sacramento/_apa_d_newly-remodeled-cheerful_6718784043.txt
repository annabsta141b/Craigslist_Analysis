This spacious one-bedroom has been fully remodeled with hardwood floors, new range, microhood above the range, tiled kitchen floor, garbage disposal, wall air conditioner, new architectural details and other upgrades. Completely clean and fresh. It has a full walk-in closet (attention women!). The unit is downstairs in a two-story building. There is a wall gas heater and a wall-mounted AC unit. There is also a ceiling fan in the bedroom and a large laundry room in the building. 
We have an explicit low noise policy in the complex. The current tenants are polite and considerate people and we are looking for more of the same.
The location is perfect: in midtown, close to the RT and the midtown Ice Blocks development with its Safeway, Peet's, Philz and other stores. Access to freeways is just a few blocks away. 
Security deposit is $1,150.  Tenant pays their individual gas and electric bills, and a share of the water/sewer bill (currently about $55/mo/unit).  No pets or smoking, and good credit is required.  Lease period is six months. Off-street parking is available for $50/mo. The building is located at 2408 P St, between 24th and 25th streets.
