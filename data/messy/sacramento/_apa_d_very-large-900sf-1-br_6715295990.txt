If you are seriously interested in renting this apartment, please have your credit report ready. My entire application review process is your good credit report. 
This unit has nine windows and therefor lots of natural light. It has hardwood floors (not pergo), newer appliances, gas stove and oven, microwave, refrigerator with ice and water dispenser, full size washer and dryer in each unit, claw foot tub with shower, ceiling fans, a shared large front balcony and a shared back porch with full size BBQ. This unit is located on the second floor on the G Street side and faces three large redwood trees. This is a secure six unit building with friendly and considerate neighbors.  
The full size BBQ on the back deck is shared with the neighbor on the second floor. There is also a small gathering area on ground floor in the back of the apartment that has a propane table fireplace and large umbrella for socializing or just hanging out.  
I will have more/better photos of the apartment in a few days.
