I've got a studio apartment in the heart of Midtown, Sacramento I'm looking to switch out of. My loss is your gain. It's a cozy spot next to Fremont Park, close to some of the restaurants/bars that make for a full Midtown experience.  It's a quick jump bike to the Golden 1 Arena, 2 minute drive to the freeway, and an even shorter walk to Zebra Club. 
This place will go quick due to it's proximity to Midown, and you'd be going through Raymond Management. I'm looking to move out November 16, 2018. Send me an email if interested!
