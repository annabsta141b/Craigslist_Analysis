Living at Villa Paradiso is like being a King on vacation every day! Two huge bedrooms, each with a walk-in closet and bathroom, half bath downstairs for guests, enclosed garage with remote, Free laundry room on premises. Gorgeous grounds, quiet (only 11 units), Roman Pool. Almost impossible to describe, as it is a unique, one of a kind place: nothing can compare to it. Check out the photos, the interior ones are all part of the Townhome (except the laundry room, of course) even though they look so huge. All the rooms are huge! Wood burning fireplace, private patios off the Master Bedroom and Living Room, more closet space than you'll believe, walk-in closets in both bedrooms, etc.   Sorry, no pets, you know how much of a mess, smells and horrid noises they make.... we kindly spare you that! 
Located in a great neighborhood, convenient, like I-5 access is 1/4 mile away, and 5 miles to Downtown. Email or call Bernard  show contact info

. I can email you a Video, or go to Youtube.com and search 'Villa Paradiso Sacramento'.  The upscale address is 6016 S. Land Park Dr, 95822. There are only 11 Townhomes at Villa Paradiso, so it is a small complex, and quiet (if you are noisy, please don't apply, thanks). And the Bargain rate is $1875/month! This is The Best! You will Love it!
