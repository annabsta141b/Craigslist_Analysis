$25 Pet Rent. Newly Renovated Interiors. 
It's a little embarrassing to have so many people passed out around our office door, it looks like we threw one heck of a party!  But we can't help it. . . we charge at least $100 a month less than the competition for our amazing apartments and whenever someone hears about it they just pass out from the shock!
Our apartment homes are the ultimate in elegance, walk-in closets and spacious floor plans. The manicured common areas include a sparkling pool heated spa, and fitness center. There's 7 onsite laundry facilities. Conveniently close to the I-80 freeway, good neighbors, attentive management, and a great location near area schools and shopping. And if you haven't soaked up enough gorgeousness here, Howe Park is a stone's throw away. Best of all, you'll save hundreds over comparable apartment homes.
