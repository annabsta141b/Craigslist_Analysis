I am looking to have my lease taken over any time before the end of the year.
I currently live in The Element Apartments, near Sac State, in a 2x2. It's fully furnished with washer/dryer in unit and WiFi/basic cable is included in rent. Rent is $814 and does not include utilities. The complex is very quiet and well pampered. There is currently a roommate living here, she's 24 and has one cat. She works from home so she is here most of the time. She's very introverted so you'll hardly notice she is there. She is 4/20 friendly. Every roommate has a separate leasing contract, so if you or she is ever late on rent, the other will not be affected. If interested, feel free to reach out. I'm looking to move by November 1st, but I will leave sooner if needed.  My number is  show contact info
