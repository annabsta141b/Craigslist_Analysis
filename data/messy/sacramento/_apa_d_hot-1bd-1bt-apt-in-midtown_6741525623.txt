Gorgeous 1bd/1bt  Gated Downstairs Apartment in a great Midtown location,  Call to set up appointment!!!  
An immaculate, modernized 1 bd/1bt upstairs Midtown apt. available now.  Rent $1225 and deposit  $800 You really have to see this place.
This unit has new DUAL PANE windows. Save on your energy bill, sound deadening, better security and they look great.
This is a small 8 unit complex that is very well maintained and very clean. Very well lit at night and gated for that added privacy. The neighbors in the area are very nice and all have properties that are very well maintained. The current tenants couldn't be any nicer. It's a very quiet complex.
This is a really good midtown area, close to the freeways, RT, shopping centers and those little midtown coffee shops. 
A courtyard is in front, it's a good spot to relax and have a barbecue. 
Some of the features of the unit include:
1)  Tiled floors and countertops in kitchen 
2)  New wood blinds
3)  Laundry facilities on site, the latest card operated, no quarters
4)  Hardwood floors throughout
5)  Ceiling fans
6)  Dualpane windows - look great, keeps noise out and energy efficient. Not to many units in midtown have these
7)  New bathroom -shower/tub, painted, upgraded with granite and new shelving, fixtures and vanity  
I do not take section 8 and small pets are negotiable.
My name is Ron and I am the owner
