I can't sleep because I spend too much time wondering how Lost is going to end.  I've got my eye on a new bed at Beck's Furniture, but the boss is holding up my bonus until I get these last few units rented.  Hurry, I'm tired!  You'll get:
Our apartment homes are the ultimate in elegance, walk-in closets and spacious floor plans. The manicured common areas include a sparkling pool heated spa, and fitness center. There's 7 onsite laundry facilities. Conveniently close to the I-80 freeway, good neighbors, attentive management, and a great location near area schools and shopping. And if you haven't soaked up enough gorgeousness here, Howe Park is a stone's throw away. Best of all, you'll save hundreds over comparable apartment homes.
