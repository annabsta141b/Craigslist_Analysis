Looking for someone to take over my lease starting mid December running through June 15th with a month to month option after that. This is a 1 bedroom 1 bath unit with 2 storage closets. There is a washer and dryer in the unit as well as a single car garage and drive way so plenty of parking for two vehicles. It is a very clean and quiet neighborhood and also pet friendly. I love it here, just looking to relocate closer to work. Please contact me via email if you are interested! (Flexible on the date for the right person)
