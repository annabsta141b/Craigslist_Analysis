Great Schools and a Great House - We have a nice 3 Bedroom 2 Bath home located in the vineyard area. The house has the bedrooms on opposite sides of the home so allows you to spread out. The Kitchen and Living room are a great room effect. The yards come with a gardener. What else could you want? Oh maybe good schools? Well this is located just up the street from one best in the school district.
