Lease takeover for a stunning 1 bedroom apartment in the heart of midtown! Sadly I will be moving for a job and won't be in Sacramento anymore. I moved into this place in May and loved living here. The location is amazing, just steps away from fantastic restaurants, bars, and a couple of blocks from the capital.
The apartment has brand new floors and is located on the 3rd floor. The apartment has a pool, hot tub, gym, and an Amazon hub. Street parking available with residential permit or you can pay for a parking pass with the management. The current lease goes until June 2019.
