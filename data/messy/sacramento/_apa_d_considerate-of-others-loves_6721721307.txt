NEW FLOORING AND STOVE!! PICTURES ATTACHED ARE OF THE UNIT THAT IS READY FOR YOU!!
If you are the type that likes to throw late-night parties, loves to really crank up the volume on your home stereo system and won't clean up after your dog (or yourself), this is not the place for you. 
Riverfront is a family-owned, pet-friendly apartment community. Several Employees live on site and we really value clean and quiet. If you do too, Riverfront is the place for you.
We've got a fabulous location in the Greenhaven/Pocket area, next to South Land Park, where we enjoy cool breezes off the Sacramento River and beautiful sunset views. We're minutes to downtown and midtown with easy access to I-5 and public transportation.
Sparkling swimming pools, waterfalls, groves of redwoods, lush lawns and gardens help create a resort-like atmosphere. For recreation, you'll get to choose between the fitness center, half basketball court or scenic river trail.
We've got spacious one and two-bedroom apartment homes (five floor-plans to fit your needs), filled with amenities for stylish and comfort living...like wood-burning fireplaces, giant windows with tree-top views, enclosed patios or view decks, vaulted ceilings...just to name a few.
