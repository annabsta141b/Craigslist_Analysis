Nothing can compare to Villa Paradiso . You will be overwhelmed, especially if you like a Classical interior and Pasadena Style exteriors! One look at this, and you will be totally spoiled, every other rental pales in comparison! 
1500 sf. It's a Townhouse, so it has a huge entry, and the bedrooms are upstairs, walk-in closets in both bedrooms, bathroom for each bedroom plus a half bath downstairs for guests, enclosed garage for one car, many private sitting areas, monumental statuary, 40 ft palms, 50 ft redwoods, flowers and mature citrus trees, very friendly neighbors, only 11 units. Machines Free in laundry room, private patio off the living room, large balcony off the master bedroom. Chandelier in dining room, ceiling fans in every room, both bedrooms and two full baths upstairs, 1/2 bath downstairs. Walk-in closets in each bedroom. Vast storage space (42 doors and drawers in kitchen alone!), wood burning fireplace, 11 ft entry hall, cloak room, wood burning fireplace, and a carpeted and marble stairway to the upstairs. In a great neighborhood, like 1/4 mile to I-5 access, then 4 minutes to Downtown! Plus, there are only 11 units total, so it is quiet (P.S., if you are noisy, please don't apply, thanks)!
Year lease, $1975 a month, a true Give Away, almost.
 Deposit $1000.  Sorry, no pets, what with how they bark, howl and make smelly carpets, can't have that for you!
