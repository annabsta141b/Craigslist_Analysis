Tuscaro Apt/Homes has an upcoming move-in date for an upstairs 2 bedroom with full-size w/d and carport parking space. This apt/home is overlooking our gazebo area. It has a bright sunny kitchen and dining area with a door directly out to the balcony.  
We have a 2 bedroom identical to this one that we can show you TODAY, so don't delay in reserving this upstairs apartment.  It will be ready to move into by October 20th.
Here at Tuscaro Apartment Homes, we provide coffee and tea daily in our lobby.  We have a business center for our residents to use any time we are open.  We have a small cabana room for socializing during office hours as well.  And our Fitness Center is open 24 hours a day.
Enjoy a swim or some relaxing time at our pool, spa and barbecue area.  Take a walk around the pond nearby or hop on your bike and jam out to the trail behind our property.
