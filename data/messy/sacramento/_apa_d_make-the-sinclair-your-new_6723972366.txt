Hello!!! We are offering 2 bedroom apartments at The Sinclair. These apartments come with a refrigerator, dishwasher, and stove, and with a stackable washer dryer within each unit. We are a gated community with amenities including a pool, BBQ, and picnic area. We are located just outside of downtown Sacramento and are a 6 minute drive from Sac state, I-50 freeway, and 2 blocks down from the famous Loehmann's Plaza. Additionally, we are kitty corner from 24 hour fitness, and a few blocks away from Kaiser Hospital. All of one's commutes can be shortened tremendously by living at The Sinclair!! We are located in the hottest part of Sacramento and are convinced that if you take a moment to come check us and our surrounding eateries out you're sure to love us!
Enjoy the convenience of the inner city without the traffic and the expensive rates!
