We have a private guest house studio apartment for rent in a highly desirable Elk Grove neighborhood.  The guest house has a full kitchen with newer appliances (refrigerator, 4 burner stove and oven, microwave, etc...) and a full bath.  All utilities (power, water, sewer, and trash)  are included in the rental price, along with cable (Xfinity premium package) and high speed internet access.  
We are looking to rent the unit to a single working professional FM with good rental references and a proven income history.
This is a single occupancy unit only, and Absolutely NO SMOKING and NO PETS!
