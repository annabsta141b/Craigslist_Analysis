Hi, my roommates and I plan to move out by December 31st. We're looking for anyone willing to take over the flat starting January. Alvarado Parkside is located in a quiet residential neighborhood. The F, G, and J lines are close by with a 10-5 minute bustime to class. Savemart and several fast food restaurants are a 5 minute walk away. It is cat friendly with a $300 pet deposit that allows up to 2 cats. Rent deposit is $500. Utilities would be pge and internet. I'd leave furnishings,cleaning supplies, etc. for an extra fee.
