Great House - We have a nice 3 Bedroom 2 Bath home located in the vineyard area. The house has the bedrooms on opposite sides of the home so allows you to spread out. The Kitchen and Living room are a great room effect. The yards come with a gardener. What else could you want? Oh maybe good schools? Well this is located just up the street from one best in the school district. We have many parks in the area and if you like to play golf then Wild Hawk Golf course is right there as well.
