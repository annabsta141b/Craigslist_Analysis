Is there a mouse in the house? A rat in the attic? How do I know if I have rodents? 
Here are some ways: 
-You see a rat or mouse during the day (this means there are many more).
-You see brown droppings about the size of rice grain or bigger, sometimes with a pointy end
-You hear animal scampering or footsteps in the attic or walls or in other usually undisturbed areas such as piles of paper, books, or yard debris outdoors
-You see teeth marks from rodents chewing on wood, paper, books, food or holes in home structures
-You smell a bad odor
-You see patterns of small tracks laced with urine, droppings, and/or nesting material
Mice and rats carry deadly diseases! Do not touch or sweep up droppings, as this is how viruses can spread. Instead, call a professional!
