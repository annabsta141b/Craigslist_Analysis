Best Pool Service monthly rates vary slightly from area to area and depend on the size of the pool, trees and shrubs, and other additional features that a pool might have.
 Both of our pool service plans include cleaning, maintenance, chemicals and minerals. If you have a spa connected to your pool the pool services listed here would also apply to the maintenance of your spa. Including a spa on the monthly maintenance will usually affect the monthly bid somewhat. The Partial Service Plan does not include netting and vacuuming.
