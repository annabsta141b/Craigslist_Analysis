This spacious downstairs one-bedroom has been fully remodeled with hardwood floors, double-glazed windows, range, tiled kitchen floor, garbage disposal, wall air conditioner, new architectural details and other upgrades. Completely clean and fresh. It has two full closets (attention women!). There is a large laundry room in the building with two washers and two dryers.
The location is perfect: at the center of midtown, two blocks from the RT and close to freeways and downtown. 
We are quite strict about noise;  our tenants are all polite people who appreciate nice places and considerate neighbors. 
No pets or smoking, and good credit is required. Tenant pays for their electricity and gas, and also a share of the water/sewer via an allocation of the city bill, currently running at about $68/mo. Deposit is $1,195. The building is located at 2414 P St, between 24th and 25th streets. Six-month lease.  To view the apartment, please email at the contact button above.
