If you are not happy with the very limited rental options available near UC Davis,   I have discovered a unique lease program that is very attractive in tight rental markets.   You are able to pick any home on the MLS within the programs flexible investment criteria and your only obligation is a 12 month lease. You may chose to extend the lease up to 5 years with predetermined rent increases.   If interested you are also able to buy the home for a predetermined price.  Email or text me for a list of homes in Davis and Woodland.
