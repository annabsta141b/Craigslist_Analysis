One bedroom apartment (700 sq ft) with patio, kitchen with new appliances, and central heat and air. Great midtown location near S St and 25th St. New paint, carpets, etc. Laundry in the building and a parking lot for residents only. Small gated apartment complex.
Lease runs through September 2019, with first month free. Move-in date negotiable. I'm the current tenant, leaving Sacramento for personal reasons, and I can show the apartment, but you apply directly to management. Contact me with any questions!
Willing to offer the first month's rent free and transfer my security deposit.
