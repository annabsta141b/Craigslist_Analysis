INCLUDED FREE 50-INCH Hitachi SMART TV. The TV was part of a move in incentive. I never opened it! I'm including it to move the apartment sooner.
I am moving out as I was hired for a job in Southern California after graduating from college.
Cable TV/Internet, trash, and water included in the price of rent. Only pay the electric bill on top rent.
