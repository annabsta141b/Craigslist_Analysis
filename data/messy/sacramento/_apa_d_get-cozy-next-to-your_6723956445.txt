Our friendly staff is here to help you 7 days a week!Hidden Oaks5979 DeVecchi AveCitrus Heights, CA 95621One of the best parts about living in a one- or two-bedroom home from Hidden Oaks is living so close to the establishments important to you. All rental homes come with large bedrooms with plenty of closet space for your wardrobe. Some homes come with laundry appliances and kitchen windows. Every rental is pet friendly and comes with a warming fireplace with mantel. When it is time to head out for the day, you will find your car under a covering or maybe in a private, detached garage if you prefer. Our property is located near Interstate 80 for quick travelling into downtown Sacramento or maybe up to Tahoe for the weekend. We are also close to the McClellan Air Force Base, the New Fountains shopping center, and recreational trails like Maidu Park.Come and tour our Sequoia model today!
