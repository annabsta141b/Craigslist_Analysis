Riverwalk Townhomes is situated 8 minutes south of downtown Sacramento in an area considered locally to be a premier place to reside. Riverwalk is near a meandering bend of the stately Sacramento River in an area termed "The Pocket" because it is surrounded by the river to the north, west and south. The area is convenient to excellent schools, recreational opportunities along the river, diverse shopping and businesses, and plenty of great restaurants and entertainment options. This area is currently home to 50,000 residents who enjoy the tranquil atmosphere that both the river and the natural landscape provide, but equally appreciate the close freeway access to the rest of Sacramento and the surrounding areas. RiverWalk Townhomes are a mixture of contemporary style and exceptional outdoor living. Whether it is enjoying the recreational amenities, strolling along the river or enjoying the riverfront parks, this unique and valuable setting is what most people desire when choosing a home for themselves and their families.
