What people are saying about The Garden at Fair Oaks Apartments:
"Pretty nice area. Good management. Lots of kids play outside during the day. I feel safe walking through this complex, even during the night time. A/C provides excellent ventilation in the living room. The rent is affordable. Laundry is cheap, which is nice. Wish there were more parking spots. Great services provided overall. Not too clear away from stores and malls. Pretty satisfied with living here so far."
