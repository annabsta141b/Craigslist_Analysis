Looking to have my lease taken over as I would be moving out of town in December because it's my last semester at sac state
The rent is $1210/month with all utilise included excluding SMUD electricity the electricity bill is an average $25-30/month. It comes with FREE WIFI/CABLE.
The apartment is a 1 bedroom apartment with a very spacious closet. It comes fully furnished.  
I have lived here for over a year and it is very convenient if you attend sac state or work downtown. Located 5 mins from Sac State. It is located close to the light rail and grocery stores are close by.
My lease ends 01/31/2019. However you can renew the lease for 6-12 months if you so desire.
There is a lease take over process we have to go through with the apartment managemt, it will take about 45mins. I put down a $250 deposit when I took the apartment which I expect to receive from you since you would get it from the apartment when you move out. 
Feel free to email or text me if you have any questions.
