Living at Villa Paradiso is like being a King on vacation every day! It's a Townhouse, so there is an Entry Hall, and is on two floors, bedrooms upstairs up a marble and carpeted stairway. Two huge bedrooms, each with a walk-in closet and a bathroom, enclosed garage with remote, two and a half bathrooms, Free laundry room on premises for Residents only. Gorgeous grounds, quiet (only 11 units), Roman Pool. Almost impossible to describe, as it is a unique, one of a kind place: nothing can compare to it. Located in a great neighborhood, convenient, like I-5 access is only 1/4 mile away, and then 5 minutes to Downtown! Sorry, no pets (you know how they bark and pee so).
