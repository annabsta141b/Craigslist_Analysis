Newly renovated 2 bedroom (both with walking closets)/2 bathroom (both double vanity) apartment available (Torrey Villas Resort Apartments). We have recently purchased a home so are looking for someone to take over the remainder of our lease (lease ends mid-March 2019). Apartment available 11/20. Stainless steel appliances (gas range), washer & dryer in garage (I prefer our floorpan over the other units- it allows for more storage off the kitchen), balcony has access off the dining area and 1 bedroom. 
Quiet community with well kept amenities & grounds- Newly renovated gym and pool. Weekly FREE yoga classes, a putting green, and trails to walk your dog! 
Great access to major freeways: Average 3 minutes to I-5, 805, and the 56.
We are eager to secure renters since we close 11/5!
