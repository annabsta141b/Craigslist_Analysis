Starting at $1730 Lease in Rocklin and Roseville with the option (but not obligation) to buy at a future date for a predetermined price.  
I have partnered with a large institutional investor willing to purchase and lease a home back to qualified tenants.  The strength of the current housing market has caused many of the rentals in more desirable suburbs like Rocklin and Roseville to be sold.  Finding a quality, stable rental has become incredibly difficult.   
It's a great option if you:
• Want to live in a single-family home, in a great community with quality schools
• Are a first-time homebuyer who's cautious about buying a home now, but may want to buy in the future
• Are a home seeker in the process of relocating but aren't sure where you want to settle down
• Can't obtain a mortgage right now
• Can't find a quality rental in the area or school district you desire
Email or text me today for more information and details about the program.
