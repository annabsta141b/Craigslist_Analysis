Living at Villa Paradiso is like being a King on vacation every day! It's a Townhouse, so there is an Entry Hall, and is on two floors, bedrooms upstairs up a marble and carpeted stairway. Two huge bedrooms, each with a walk-in closet and a bathroom, enclosed garage with remote, two and a half bathrooms, Free laundry room on premises for Residents only, and we pay for all your utilities except the gas and electricity you use! Gorgeous grounds, quiet (only 11 units), Roman Pool. Almost impossible to describe, as it is a unique, one of a kind place: nothing can compare to it. Located in a great neighborhood, convenient, like I-5 access is only 1/4 mile away, and then 5 minutes to Downtown! Sorry, no pets (you know how they bark and pee so).
