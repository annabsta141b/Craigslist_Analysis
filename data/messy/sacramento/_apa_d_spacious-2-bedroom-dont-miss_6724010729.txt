Green Valley is all about the simple things in life. With our lush landscaping, shady trees and mountain views, you'll forget all about your problems. Green Valley is minutes away from Cameron Park Lake, and about 10 mins from Folsom Lake, 
with local camping.  Whether you're running the trails or adventuring in the Lake Tahoe area, Green Valley will welcome you home after a long day. With all the awe-inspiring things to do within walking and biking distance of your new home & City bus stop right out front of our community, its likely your car will get a little jealous. So when you need to show your four wheeled friend some love, our SUPER easy access to Highway 50 will have you out and about anywhere in Folsom or El Dorado with very little effort at all. 
 Like to shop?   The Palladio at Folsom has it all and within close distance to Green Valley but far away enough to enjoy the slower paced life of Beautiful Cameron Park.
