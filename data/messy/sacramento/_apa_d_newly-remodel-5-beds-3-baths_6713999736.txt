A newly remodeled single family house is 0.5 miles from Southport Town Center. New tile floor downstairs, new kitchen granite countertop, new carpet upstairs and new bathroom showers. Target, Nugget Market and Lowe's are within the walking distance. The recreation center is also across the street of the community. It is really convenient to go around the town for sport (Riley Field and Golden 1 Center), Crocker Art museum, Railroad museum, Zoo, Fairytale town, and restaurants in downtown and midtown. It is a great place to raise a family.  It is the hub of inter-state I-80, I-5 and highway 50. 5-10 mins to downtown, 15-20 mins drive to UC Davis University campus, and 100 miles to South Lake Tahoe.
