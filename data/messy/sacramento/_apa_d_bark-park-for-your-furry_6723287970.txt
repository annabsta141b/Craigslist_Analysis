Dear Humans:
It has been brought to my attention that there is a community in the beautiful Arden area that loves pets. As your loyal, loving companion, I feel it is my duty to make sure you are aware of The Palms Apartments. And for you to know that this is where I want our new home to be. 
The Palms Apartments is the most beautiful apartments in the Sacramento area, with resort designed lagoon pool! I heard they have 2 and 3 bedrooms with washers and dryers so you can wash my bed (The cat drooled on it. Again. The only problem with this place is that they allow cats, too...) At The Palms, they have one, two and three bedroom apartments, with LOTS of storage space! And the lush landscaping makes for many great places for me to sniff! PLUS! There are SQUIRRELS for me to look at!
If you move me to The Palms, I promise to stop eating your slippers. Maybe. 
Love,
Dog
PS - Feed me a biscuit. Thank you.
