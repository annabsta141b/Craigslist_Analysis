Do you desire to live in Sacramento but yearn for nature out your back door?  How about having the American River as your backyard?!  This secluded area is like having your own private beach.  This opportunity is so rare there are no other homes available for rent along the American River in Sacramento County!  This house has an open floor plan and is great for entertaining.  The neighbors are a friendly group of mostly young professionals of all sorts (i.e. doctors, teachers, lawyers, professors, nurses and a even a cool group of stay at home moms and dads).  Commute to downtown is quick via I-50.  The light-rail is a half mile from the house.  This single story home has one master suite and three additional bedrooms.  There are two full bathrooms.  The kitchen is large with an island and plenty of storage.  Please contact us if you are interested in viewing this home.  This house will rent quickly so don't delay.  The home is available December 1st or possibly earlier upon negotiation.  
Open House
Sunday, Nov 11th from 12pm-4pm.
