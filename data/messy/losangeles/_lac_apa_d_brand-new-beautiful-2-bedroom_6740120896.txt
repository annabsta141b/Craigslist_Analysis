You have to check out this gem of a property steps from Koreatown. We took a charming 1940s 4-plex and turned it to a modern, 21st century residence with keeping the charm of the early 20th century style and architecture. 
This beautiful apartment has two bedrooms and a large den (or can be used as a 3rd bedroom), large bay windows, lots of closets, a fantastic brand new bathroom and an extremely large kitchen with dining area, brand new appliances and granite countertops and brand new hardwood floor throughout the unit. 
Air Conditioning. Washer/driver in the unit. Fully secured property. Private entrance.  Parking. Courtyard.
You couldn't ask for anything more. Approx. 1,000 square feet.
