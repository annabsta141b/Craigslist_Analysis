** NEED GOOD CREDIT AND JOB REFERENCE **
$1075 + 1 month security deposit
We are looking for a third roommate for a 3 bed 2 bath apartment we are applying to. 
The apartment is ours if we can find a roommate with good credit and references ASAP. 
It is a beautiful, updated apartment with dark wood floors throughout and a clean white kitchen. The walls will be repainted white or gray instead of tan. I work in interior design and having a beautiful living space is important to me. You would have your choice of sharing a bathroom or a private bathroom for $50 more. 2 parking spots. The price is great. The location is awesome and close to everything. Its 2 minutes from the 10 freeway and La Cienaga (cross street Guthrie & garth) so you can get to Santa Monica in 10 minutes or downtown in 20, also perfect for someone who works in West Hollywood or a UCLA student. It's central to everything. The neighborhood is safe and inexpensive, and there are bus lines in walking distance.
We are young professionals who are very busy (I'm also taking night classes at smc to finish my degree) and we prefer someone who is chill, easy to communicate with, clean, and not a homebody. You will have to fill out an application to be on the lease so good credit and a stable job is a must. We are signing a lease for 18 months but you can rent the room month to month and move out anytime as long as you have someone to fill your place. 
No pets and no (cigarette) smokers. 
Relaxed and positive people please email me asap :)
