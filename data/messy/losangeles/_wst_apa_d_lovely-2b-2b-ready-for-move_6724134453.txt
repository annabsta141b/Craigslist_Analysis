The beach is nearby, and USC, Loyola Marymount, OTIS College of Art and Design, shopping, dining and more are just minutes away. But perhaps the nicest part of living at The Madrid Townhomes & Flats is the sense of community spirit. From catered barbecues to resident appreciation days, we are always finding ways to make you feel welcome.
