Hey! Room for rent in a 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment in the heart of Noho Arts District. Month to month. Utilities and WiFi included. There's a spotless private bathroom in the room you'd have and a HUGE walk-in closet. Huge king sized foam mattress, futon couch, coffee table, desk, chair and 45in flatscreen with Roku. You'd also have your own gated covered parking space. Super clean, peaceful and quiet. Please be the same. There is no credit check. Pets are ok. Couples are ok. Short term is ok but long term is preferred! Guests are ok. Plenty of kitchen space. Central air. Quiet neighborhood with everything you need in walking distance. 
Will go fast! I can send you a video of the place no problem. Definitely worth it. I'm an assistant and I work full time, so you'd have the apartment to yourself mostly. I'm pretty chill so you'd never have any problems out of me. Email me a photo and brief description of yourself to schedule a viewing. $1250 deposit plus $1250 rent is due at move in. 
I need someone by Wednesday 11/7 or Thursday 11/8 the latest. 
Thanks for reading!
