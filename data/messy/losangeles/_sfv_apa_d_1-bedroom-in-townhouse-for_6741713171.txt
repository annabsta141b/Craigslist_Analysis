Hello,
Looking for potential long term roommates to fill an extra bedroom (Note: Room won't be available until the 1st of January). We have a townhouse located in Van Nuys, full Kitchen, laundry inside the unit, 2 available  parking spaces (we alternate street parking) and 3 bedrooms, one private master with a bathroom and the other two rooms share a bathroom. We also have singular bathroom downstairs for guests. Your room will be the one with a Shared bathroom (unfurnished). Your share for Rent will be $673 plus utilities in addition to a 666 dollar deposit before moving in. As far as us, we are two men (one straight, one gay) 39 & 27. Both work full time and one of us in school. Very laid back, 420 friendly, anime nerds, and hard workers, not big partiers so would prefer someone who isn't aswell. We Do are best to keep the common areas as clean as possible (kitchen, living room and shared bathroom) so as long as your conscious of cleaning up after yourself we will be good. You will need to provide some proof of income, and a credit check if you want to be put on the lease. If you are interested and would like to set up day and time to meet or would like me to forward pics of the place I would be more than happy to do so. Please email me at the craislist email address for any questions or concerns you may have. We look forward to hearing from you!
