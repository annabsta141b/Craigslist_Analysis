Our apartment homes have a modern, clean look that will make you feel right at home in within the gorgeous historical architecture.  This Santa Monica, CA community is made up of new residences of superior quality paired with classic design. Located on the corner of Third and Arizona streets, the property is just two blocks from Santa Monica Beach where you can relax and enjoy the beautiful California weather.  Criterion Promenade overlooks the world-famous Third Street Promenade where there is a variety of fun things to do and see, as well as upscale shopping. Just steps away from your front door, you'll find Santa Monica's Farmer's Market on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  Plus, first-class gourmet dining, and both cultural and entertainment opportunities that aren't found anywhere else. Feeling playful? The Pacific Park is just a quick jaunt down the street for all of your fun-loving adventures.  Time for work? We're close to Google, Santa Monica College and of course all of the retail stores.
