Nestled against the mountains of sunny Pasadena, Avila is moments away from bustling shops, lively caf√©s, eclectic art galleries and lush parks. With everything Old Town has to offer the decision of whether to go out or stay in has never been more difficult. The Avila community is welcoming and warm, bringing new life to this incredible location. Merging classic Spanish-style architecture with the modern Mediterranean, Avila incorporates an old world aesthetic in an authentic way. This new kid on the block also just happens to be the coolest, with unique, funky elements that give it a youthful vibe. From customized co-working spaces to a bright, airy arcade, this is an environment that residents will want to come home to, not to mention a great place for get togethers. Avila, where classic Spanish meets modern Mediterranean. Coming to Pasadena in Summer 2018.
