I am ending my Lease on this beautiful beautiful one bedroom apartment in the heart of franklin Village, Beachwood Canyon. Located in a French Normandie style magical fairy tale courtyard. Hardwood Floors throughout, Sun drenched windows, vintage detailing throughout.  Available December 1st.
One block from Gelsons, and the entire Franklin Village shopping strip. Across the street from the wonderful Oaks for a morning coffee, La Poubelle for beautiful dinners, Upright Citizen Brigade for laughs. Steps from Hollywood and everything it has to offer. Walking distance to so many things, and parking included.
This will go fast!! Such a beautiful area and stunning home.
