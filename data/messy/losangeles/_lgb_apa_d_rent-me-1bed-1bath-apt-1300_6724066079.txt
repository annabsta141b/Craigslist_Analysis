Looking for great, long term, responsible tenants to rent our apt. You will have a landlord who lives in the front main house and great upstairs neighbors. We have a 1bed, 1bath lower level apt for rent in the heart of Cambodia Town. 1-car garage will be added by next year (at no extra charge to tenant). Apt has hardwood floors & big windows w/ security bars & storm doors for added security. Apt can be viewed, but is in the process of being moved out of and will be cleaned and move-in ready on Nov 3, 2018. 
Month-to-month, 6 month or 12 month lease available
No pets, no indoor smoking, no drugs. We just want respectful & responsible tenants. Everyone on the premises either works or goes to school or both. 
THE COST:
Monthly rent: $1300 
Security Deposit: $650 (Refundable upon move-out, less damages other than normal wear & tear)
Applicant Credit Check: $30 per adult (due when you turn in your application)
Holding Fee: $100 (if we approve your application for rental & you want us to hold the apt for you, this fee is due. It is NON-REFUNDABLE if you decide NOT to move-in. If you DO move in, this fee will be applied to your security deposit upon lease signing)
*serious inquiries only, please do not waste yours or our time. Please text only (562-489-39five-six) or email if you are interested in viewing the apt. Please remember when viewing: current tenant is still in the process of moving out. Apt will be professionally deep cleaned before Nov 3, 2018.*
