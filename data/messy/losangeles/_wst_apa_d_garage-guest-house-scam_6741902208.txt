Got scammed out of a deposit by a guy who went by Eric Thomas Bishop.  Claimed to have an above garage apartment at 1925 S Bentley Ave, all bills paid.  Great con job.  Told me he was an audio engineer recording an album in SF but would be back to the property in a couple weeks.  I am relocating and need something sight unseen, unfortunately, so I was gullible.  He used the phone number  show contact info
 which is listed through Sprint to belong to a Randy Jandt.  He used a long game on me.  I recommended that I wanted to pay a deposit to secure the place.  I asked him how I could lock it down.  He mentioned he didn't have a smart phone and was a little old school, didn't have paypal or venmo or any apps.  I mentioned Western Union and he came up with a story about not being able to renew his drivers license so he needed the money to be sent with a security question instead.  Mind you, we had mulitple long conversations about the property, location, details, etc.  I expected an email with a confirmation of deposit after sending the money, and again, I came up with the idea of how to send it.  After he picked up the cash, he didn't return any calls, didn't answer, I started to look more into it and found out about the Sprint number and then called the tax office and there was no listing on Bentley under the last name Bishop.  He was good.  Don't fall for it.  I saw he has listed this and removed it before on a couple other forums.  Don't fall for it like I did.
