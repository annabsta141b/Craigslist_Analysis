Designed by renowned Nadel Architects, Gayley & Lindbrook Apartments feature a dramatic and highly-articulated limestone and brick exterior with luxuriously appointed interiors in a variety of floor plans, along with handy amenities like a rooftop soaking pool, subterranean parking and social spaces.
At Gayley + Lindbrook, we believe a true community shouldn't be gated or fenced in, it should seamlessly meld into its surroundings. That's why we chose LA's beautiful Westwood neighborhood for our location. Westwood is part of the Wilshire Corridor, a beautifully planned commercial shopping district in close proximity to the UCLA Campus. A straight shot down Santa Monica Boulevard to the beaches and in the shadow of the Hollywood Hills, Westwood is centrally located.Property Features:
