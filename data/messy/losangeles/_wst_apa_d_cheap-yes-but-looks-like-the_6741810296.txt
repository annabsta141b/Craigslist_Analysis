I'm so cheap, I bought my kids an Xbox 180.  I wear an imitation fake Rolex, and I got married just for the free rice.  I'm so cheap, when someone rings the doorbell I make my kids yell "Ding-Dong" just to save the electricity!  But I can't figure out how my boss can afford to make the rent here so cheap!  We have the cheapest bachelor   available in Palms according to Rentometer.com 
Our manager is attentive and courteous, and our tenants are good folks who've lived with us for a long time.  We have a great location near the 10 and 405 Freeways.  Trader Joe's is right around the corner.  The trendy Culver City restaurants and night spots are close by.  This is a Very Walkable neighborhood, so you don't even need a car. . .
