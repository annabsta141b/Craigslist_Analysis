Facebook should have a Dislike button so we can deal with boring status updates, Farmville, Lil' Green Patch, and stupid comments. In fact, it would be great if we had a Dislike button in real life, especially for some of the crummy apartments that are up on CL.
But check out our place! It's hard to believe you can get something this cool for just $1450 a month!!! Like it? You'll LOVE it!!
Perfect for anyone working in or near North Hollywood, with the kind of charm you're apt to find in those delightful apartments they built a few years back. Our gorgeous 1 bedroom has NEW carpet and NEW flooring!!! It is also equipped with air conditioner. There's parking, plenty of great restaurants and shopping nearby, and easy access to the 170 Freeway. Our manager keeps everything in top shape!
