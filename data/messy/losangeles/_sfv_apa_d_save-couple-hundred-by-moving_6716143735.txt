If you think the Valley is too far North, we're right by the 170 Freeway, which means that Burbank, Universal City, and Downtown are just minutes away. If you think there's nothing to do in the Valley, Laurel Canyon shopping, restaurants, and the Valley Plaza Park; Library are walking distance from our building.   
These are spacious and handsome apartments overlooking a serene courtyard.  It's a secure building with covered parking and extra storage available too!
