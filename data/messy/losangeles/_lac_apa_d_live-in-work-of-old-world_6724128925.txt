There are only 2 spaces in all of Los Angeles-and possibly the world-that have a door shaped like a quarter circle. And both of those spaces are only at The Fabulous Casa Rita. And if the front door is a work of art, you may only imagine what adventures await you inside your charming new home !
You are instantly greeted with the original blonde, hardwood floors and high ceilings in a space that is both light and airy.
There are 2 walk in closets in the living room, and one is large enough to be used as an office.
Your kitchen is a chef's dream with plenty of upper and lower cupboard space. We even have the original icebox from 1930. But not to worry, there is a large, newer fridge and stove for all of your culinary adventures.
The kitchen offers warm Spanish tiles throughout and all the way to the service porch where a stackable washer & dryer is included.
The bathroom has the original Art Deco tiles in a black and lavender motif. There's also a built in chest of drawers for all of your sundry items. Yes, of course there's a hugh towel closet, because that's what 30's luxury was all about.
And you bedroom offers super high, coved ceilings with another walk in closet and mirrored door. Of course, we still have the original Art Deco sconces.
And just inches from your front door is a lush, Spanish courtyard garden with banana palms and greenery.
Your eye will be delighted by the hand carved balconies and the ornately tiled stairways. It's an unexpectedly romantic oasis, nestled away in the heart of the city.
If you love and appreciate Old World Craftsmanship, then welcome to your future happy home.
