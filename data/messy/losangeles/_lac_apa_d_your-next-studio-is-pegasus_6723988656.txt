	This open concept studio has a very cozy yet spacious feel to it, and also provides for plenty of closet and kitchen space to utilize. Our floor plan #13 faces an interior courtyard, effectively tucked away from all surrounding street noise of downtown LA, while still receiving a very enjoyable amount of natural sunlight exposure. This apartment home features hardwood flooring, accent walls, granite counter tops, and all electric appliances,  which include a stainless steel oven/stove, an in-unit washer/dryer, dishwasher, microwave, and refrigerator to make you feel right at home. 
	Next door to the best of downtown buildings, bars, restaurants and shops in the Financial District. Plus, the Metro, Staples and LA Live are just around the corner.
