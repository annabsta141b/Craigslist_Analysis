Living at Capulet Apartments gives you access to the best of Downtown Los Angeles in a beautifully renovated turn-of-the-century apartment home. 
Conveniently located in the City West neighborhood of downtown, Capulet Apartments is within walking distance to a huge array of retail, entertainment and other services and to the 7th Street subway station that connects you to both the Red and Purple subway lines. Capulet Apartments is located next to the Mayfair Hotel which is undergoing a multi-million dollar renovation.  The two story lobby is almost done being renovated with new large bar area designed to resemble the living room of a 1920s mansion, a new second floor restaurant and bar and roof top deck with pool.  Also, just around the corner on 7th St. is the renovated Teregram Ballroom and Caf√© with great live music acts and food.  Plans were submitted to build a 29 story apartment bldg. across the street at 7th & Witmer with 5,000 SF of ground floor retail.
Capulet Apartments is proud to offer a spacious studio apartment home that features granite counter-tops, wood flooring, and designer two-tone paint. All this and being able to walk to LA Live and Staples Center, Regal Cinemas, Fig at 7th (Target, H & M, Zara, Sprinkles Cupcakes) and Ralph's supermarket. It just doesn't get any better than this! 
This property has been given an aesthetic facelift to include interior and exteriors murals, painted by local artists. The courtyard has been completely renovated and is now an oasis for your enjoyment.
