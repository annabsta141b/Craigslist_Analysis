We help our clients find places to live. They let us know where their looking how much they want to pay per month and all of their search details. Our client's usually have issues finding places own their own due to lower credit scores, bankruptcies, repossessions, Large pets. We assign you to an agent who will gather your qualifications and individually reach out to managers, and landlords on your behalf. Don't spend you day calling managers to view places you're not qualified for. Our service will save time and money on application fees
