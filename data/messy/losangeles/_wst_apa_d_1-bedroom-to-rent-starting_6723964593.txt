Looking for someone to take over my bedroom in a 2 bedroom/2 bath apartment. The living space and kitchen will come mostly furnished but you're more than welcome to add to the space. Tandem parking.
The bedroom you'd be occupying has a full private bathroom and walk-in closet. 
Utilities (Time Warner, Electricity, and Gas) are not included. Usually is about $100 a month.
Your fabulous roommate - Cismale, late 20s, nurse, clean and respectful.
