DESCRIPTION
Stately with spacious rooms, high ceilings and so much light streaming in from so many windows. In the glimmer of the ebony hardwoods, the stunning original fireplace and graceful lines, go ahead and feel elegant wrapped up in its vintage charm.
The updated, sunny kitchen is fresh and snowy from the appliances to the open shelving and even a large breakfast nook with too cute built-ins. Its crisp clean look is a blank canvas to express your panache and style. Are you modern? Retro? Country living? This is your kitchen.
The master is oh so roomy. It's such a roomy room. Get majestic and regal - plenty of space for that king bed. You know what else is regal? Your very own washer/dryer. 
Coveted Ktown location! UHmazing Korean BBQ all over, karaoke your heart out, see a film at the super-cool CGV cinema, have a late night latte in the back garden of The Loft Cafe or impress your friends with drinks at The swank Normandie Club and dinner at the gorgeous Commissary at The Line Hotel. Oh so close to public transport, Larchmont Village, Silverlake, Echo Park, Downtown, Miracle Mile and the 101.
Grab this beaut while you can - it'll go fast.
