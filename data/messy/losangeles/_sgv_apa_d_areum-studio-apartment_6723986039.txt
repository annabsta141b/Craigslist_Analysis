I need to transfer to a 2 bedroom apartment so my studio is available for takeover. You must apply and be approved as the unit will not stay in my name.
I am the first to ever live in this studio and have only been here 4 months. Everything is brand new and high end. This place has all the luxury amenities you could ever imagine, I'd suggest you take a tour or message me any questions you may have.
24/7 security patrolled gated parking space is included as well as tons of guest parking.
The studio apartments here are far and few between to come by so here is your chance to get a rare deal!
