You're probably looking for a modern 1 bedroom Apt with a Washer and Dryer in the apartment, in a nice area with nice facilities but are finding them pretty pricey. Anything in this area is over $2000 plus you'd pay utilities on top of that. Please consider this opportunity as it will be a win-win for both of us :)
I have a large 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment and I spend all my time in my bedroom. The living room is empty and the other side of the apartment will also be empty by the end of the month. Private bedroom with walk-in closet and a nice big bathroom.
I have everything you need. Cable TV, wi-fi, housekeeper, all utilities already set up and I'll include in the rent but would appreciate a flat rate contribution towards them of $150 monthly (They are approx $400-500monthly). 
I have a housekeeper monthly. You have your own parking space in the garage and you will feel like you're living in luxury.
I also have a Queen Sleep Number bed, bookshelves, Lighting etc if you need a Furnished bedroom.
Good credit and verifiable proof of income is required to be on the lease (ends May at which time we can renew)
$1000 Deposit
