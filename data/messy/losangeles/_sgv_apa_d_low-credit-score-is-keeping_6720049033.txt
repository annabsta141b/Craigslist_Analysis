If your low credit score is keeping you for signing a lease we can still help you. Our service will get you in direct contact with managers and landlords. We explain your situation to them in advance, so you receive calls from people willing to work with you. Our service will help you save money on gas, application fees, by keeping you away from places you are unqualified for. Stop letting your credit score hold you back, and give us a call!
