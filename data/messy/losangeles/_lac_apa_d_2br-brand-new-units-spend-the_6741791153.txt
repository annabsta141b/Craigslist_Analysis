Schedule your private appointment today and reserve your apartment for a $1000 gift card at move-in! The Perch Apartments is a brand new community close to restaurants, shops, and bars along Colorado Blvd. and York Blvd. 
Charming, walkable shopping streets and shady residential blocks make Eagle Rock and its sister neighborhood, Highland Park, feel like a small-town oasis within the city. This part of Los Angeles is known for residential pockets flush with old trees and cozy family homes. At The Perch, you're steps away from the two main-drag shopping streets that characterize the area. On Colorado Blvd, you'll find old-school restaurants and delis that have made their name here for decades selling pastrami sandwiches, classic hamburgers, and some of the city's best (cheap) pizza. York, like a vein running through the heart of Highland Park, is chock-full of fledgling new businesses like coffee shops and specialty food stores, catering to the community's younger crowd. It's all so quaint, you'd be forgiven for forgetting that you're only 20 minutes from the dynamic urban energy of Downtown Los Angeles, and even fewer from the charming, old-town vibes of Pasadena.
