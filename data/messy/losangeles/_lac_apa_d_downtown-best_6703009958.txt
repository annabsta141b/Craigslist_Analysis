This downtown Los Angeles loft isn't going to last long, so come view it today:) It is upgraded better than most lofts in the area, PLUS it's cheaper than most of them as well. I am a private owner, I've remodeled the whole thing, it looks extraordinary and is now ready to be rented! I allow pets, I must have someone with good credit and I'll only accept 12 month leases. The loft is about 800 sq ft ,2 BEDROOM ,has nice floors,BALCONY,dark stained wooden cabinets in the kitchen, stainless steel appliances  and even YOUR OWN STACKABLE WASHER AND DRYER IS INCLUDED! The building offers 24/7 lobby security ,GYM and rooftop POOL   Please call  show contact info
 if you're interested. Move fast because I won't have it on the market long, before it gets swept up:)
