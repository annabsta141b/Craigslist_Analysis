This beautiful, perfectly-manicured community offers you life's luxuries and a true sense of neighborhood. You'll come home to a park-like setting with the feel of an urban oasis. The beach is nearby, and USC, Loyola Marymount, OTIS College of Art and Design, shopping, dining and more are just minutes away. But perhaps the nicest part of living at The Madrid Townhomes & Flats is the sense of community spirit. From catered barbecues to resident appreciation days, we are always finding ways to make you feel welcome. Plus, you can commute less and enjoy life more since we're minutes from LAX and the 405, 105 and 10 Freeways, as well as the Howard Hughes Center, Westfield Mall and Marina Del Rey. Whether you're browsing apartments for rent in Los Angeles, eyeing Westchester apartments, or searching for apartments near LAX, consider making the conveniently-located Madrid your new home.
