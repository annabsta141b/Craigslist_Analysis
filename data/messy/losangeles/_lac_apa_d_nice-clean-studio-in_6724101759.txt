Very nice, clean studio apartment in the Hollywood Hills available immediately for one person! Utilities included are gas, water and trash. Terrific location in a very happening and artsy part of town (Pantages, Gelson's, W Hotel, UCB, Shake Shack, Pressed Juicery, Dunkin' Donuts, 101 entrance/ exit, Hollywood Sign, Bronson Canyon and 101 Cafe). Quiet building with pool, gym, laundry, parking, housekeeper, intercom. Nice tenants!
