Living in the San Fernando Valley
The San Fernando Valley is located in Southern California and is nestled up against the Santa Monica Mountains. This urbanized valley mixes the big city lifestyle with small town charm.
It provides a wide variety of experiences from shopping malls to neighborhood boutiques, an array of restaurants for all palates, and artist communities of music, theater, and dance to explore.
Boasting beautiful, year round Mediterranean type weather conditions, the valley is a mecca of garden parks, city parks, neighborhood parks, recreational areas and open space preserves. This makes San Fernando Valley an ideal place to live and work!
