 Protect Your Belongings With Renters Insurance from United Direct Insurance!Why buy renters insurance?
If you're a renter, you may not think you need insurance at all. (Your landlord already has insurance on the building, right?) But you may not realize that your landlord's policy doesn't cover any of your personal property. What would happen if:
•	Your apartment building burned down
•	A thief broke into your town house
•	A guest slipped and injured himself in your kitchen
•	The home/apartment you're renting suffered water damage
Without renters insurance, you've got no coverage for personal property loss or damage. Fortunately, you can get affordable renters insurance (also called apartment insurance) to help protect you in situations like these, get a free renters insurance quote -
