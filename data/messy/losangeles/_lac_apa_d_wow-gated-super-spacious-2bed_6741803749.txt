DESCRIPTION
When you live in Cameo Woods, coming home really is leaving it all behind. Once through the gate of this secure 27-acre property, you're out of the urban and into your own secret garden.
Plush with flowers and blossoming trees, you can walk out your door and stroll over to the lavish courtyard, have a seat on a bench with a book and forget about everything but your book and the trees. Or maybe you take the dog for a walk around the property along one of the many paths and pay a visit to the private dog run to chitchat with neighbors.
Not to brag, but you should invite your friends over to sunbathe by the pool, relax in the jacuzzi or play tennis on the property's private court.
Then have them over to your comfortable 2 bedroom and entertain in your spacious living room with serene views of green.
You can cook up a feast easy breezy in this kitchen with its generous wide counters, cabinet space, stainless appliances, and dishwasher.
And you'll be able to dress the part of glamorous host as the bedrooms have ample closets and storage space with mirrored floor to ceiling sliding doors, so you'll always look dapper. A wall of mirrors and views of green -- your room is already feng shui.
When you do venture beyond the gates, it won't take you long to get where you are going from this central location. LAX, Beverly Hills, Culver City and Century City are a stone's throw with easy access to the 10, and the new Expo Line Metro at LaCienega and Jefferson is so close you can walk.
Speaking of walking, Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook and Kenneth Hahn Recreational Area are minutes away when you are in the mood for a more challenging uphill climb and spectacular views of LA.
Oh, and there is a Target literally across the street. Pssh. . .forget a private tennis court -- that is luxury. Westfield Mall and Westfield Pavilion are nearby too as are plenty of great restaurants and cafes!
