Hello! We are looking for a roommate to join us in our lovely townhome located in West LA! The townhome is located in the neighborhood of Sawtelle (Japan Town) right off the 405 in between Santa Monica Blvd and Wilshire Blvd. The townhome has been refurbished with new wood floors, carpet, paint, showers, and cabinetry. We have in house laundry and the water is included in rent. Other amenities include a BBQ, air conditioning, furnished living room, and much more!
Rent includes a room with a private bathroom and shower, storage, and a parking spot in a secure garage. Looking to have our new tenant sign a 1 year lease.
A little background on us, I am a construction manager and my girl friend is an architect. We are both 24 years old, graduated from Cal Poly SLO, and really enjoy getting outside and exploring LA.
We would like to meet you and show you our place if this townhome sounds like a place for you!
