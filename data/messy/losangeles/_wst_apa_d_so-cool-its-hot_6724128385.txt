Ok, it's now Thursday. And you've seen some serious nonsense for rent. I know: what were they thinking??
But LUCKY YOU!!  We have a newly buffed out 2 bedroom, one bath that will melt your heart!
You'll know that THIS is your place the second you open the front door. Light & Airy throughout with NEW hardwood floors, this magnificent space plays like a New York Penthouse with Los Angeles prices. 
Have you seen some schlocky kitchens you wouldn't use to boil an egg?  Wellll....
We have added brand NEW STAINLESS STEEL APPLIANCES !!! Stove, Fridge, Microwave....And even a Dishwasher the science has shown will add 7 years to your life.
That's right! Leasing this hot two bedroom will extend your life ! Science Says So.
Your huge living room window beautifully captures the Downtown Los Angeles skyline. So romatic as the sky fades from purple dusk to twilight.
Ok, so there's just one left. So, don't be filled with regret on Friday wgen someone far less deserving grabs this. Nail this find tomorrow. Really , your friends will wonder how you nailed this smoking hot home. I'll tell you how: you met me tomorrow!!
