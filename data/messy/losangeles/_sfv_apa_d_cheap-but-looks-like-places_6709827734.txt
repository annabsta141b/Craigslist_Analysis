I'm so cheap, I bought my kids an Xbox 180.  I wear an imitation fake Rolex, and I got married just for the free rice.  I'm so cheap, when someone rings the doorbell I make my kids yell "Ding-Dong" just to save the electricity!  But I can't figure out how my boss can afford to make the rent here so cheap!  
A 1 BR apartment for just $1450 per month. NEW carpet with NEW flooring!
