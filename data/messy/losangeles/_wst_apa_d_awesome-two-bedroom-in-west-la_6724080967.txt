	 Altitude is a brand-new apartment community opening early June. You'll be the first to live in this apartment home. The kitchen is a chef's dream with sparkling new stainless appliances including a gas range, an island perfect for food prep and seating as well as glistening quartz counters. 
	Our newly developed community has everything you could want in your new home!  Not only is there a saltwater pool and hot tub, but there are two state of the art clubhouses, and you will only need your one keyfob to allow you access to the building and the amenities as well as your own apartment!
