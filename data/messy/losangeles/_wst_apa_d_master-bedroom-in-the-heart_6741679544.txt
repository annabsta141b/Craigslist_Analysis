Beautiful, spacious and bright room in the heart of downtown Culver city. Private bathroom and convenient parking space. Gas, electricity and internet excl and shared with two girls in our mid and late twenties. Total utilities are about 50$ per month per person. Access to large kitchen and living room area. Washer and dryer in the apartment. 
This is a very small building (only 3 apartments) in a beautiful and safe residential area, walking distance to shops and restaurants, Trader Joes and Starbucks, yoga, Culver Studios and Sony. 
We are ideally looking for another girl. We are very clean and home is quiet. Everyone is very respectful of one-another and kind. We both work full time and look for someone kind, respectful and responsible. Occasionally we have people over and you would have the same rights and responsibilities as everyone else.
