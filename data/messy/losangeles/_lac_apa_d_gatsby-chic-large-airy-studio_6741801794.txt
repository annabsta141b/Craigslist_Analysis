DESCRIPTION 
Welcome to The Ashby!
 This beautiful, Art Deco building has been remodeled to its former glory from the outside in. With unique, enchanting Deco details, smart, stylish updates and a great community vibe. The building will soon have a cool rec room with a pool table, large screen TV and even a putting green! How cool is that?
This gorgeous, huge studio features: Newer, real inky hardwoods, 12 ft ceilings framed by uniquely stunning Deco mouldings that I dare you to stop staring at. The large eat-in kitchen has glossy, deep grey shaker cabinetry, white corian counters and brand new stainless microwave, gas stove and fridge. The charming, picture window lets in tons of sunlight.
Located on a coveted street in Koreatown close to some of the best BBQ in Los Angeles like the incredible Honey Pig - try it, trust me. The classic Taylor's Steakhouse is an institution and just down the street is the super fun R Bar where you and your friends can listen to live bands and feast on their outstanding rosemary fries - delish! Then work it off at the Yogaworks just a couple of blocks away!
This unique space will not stay long!
