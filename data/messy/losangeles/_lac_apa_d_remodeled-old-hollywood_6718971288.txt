Welcome home to that Old Hollywood courtyard charm.  Nestled in the bustling heart of West Hollywood, this highly desirable area is the prime location for nightlife.  Walk to countless shops, restaurants (we like to call them #SuiteSpots), Melrose Avenue for shopping, and the famous Sunset Strip.  For convenience, Gelson's Grocery and City Hall are located right across the street (don't worry, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods are nearby too).
