	You will want to call this gem home. Our 586 square foot one bedroom features a fully equipped kitchen with stainless steel appliances. You will enjoy a refrigerator, gas range stove, microwave and dishwasher. It is adorned with gray stone counter tops and a white tile back splash. 

The flooring has been upgraded to a sand toned wood plank leaving a bright look in the apartment. This is fantastic for clean up too. No more need to vacuum. 

Even though it is a one bedroom, you have parking for two cars. This is a huge value.
