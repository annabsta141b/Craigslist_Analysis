This apartment is located atop a hill and faces into our nature setting. It is a top floor apartment with vaulted ceilings, Berber carpet, and a brand new kitchen and bath. 

The kitchen is gourmet with brand new stainless steel appliances. This includes a refrigerator, stove, dishwasher and microwave. The kitchen is adorned with white cabinetry, quartz stone counter tops in a deep gray, and it features a white tile back splash. 

The bathrooms have been updated with gray stone tile and the same counter tops and cabinets. This apartment is unique in that the master bedroom has a private vanity sink area that has a door to separate it from the shared bath. This is also right next to the large walk in closet. 

The hallway features additional ample storage which leads to the guest bedroom. Your living room even has a gas fireplace right before exiting to the patio. The patio is large and is tree lined.

Come and see this gem today.
