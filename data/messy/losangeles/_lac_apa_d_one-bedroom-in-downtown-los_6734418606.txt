Vue Los Feliz Apartments is a luxury apartment community with great amenities and an even greater location. Thanks to all of our residents because they are our greatest asset. Our residents are mostly focused on an advanced course of study or working at a career whether it be professional or an internship in the "industry" to fill out a resume. The focus of each individual keeps them busy and makes for a great apartment living experience. We believe we have the nicest, most cooperative and considerate collection of residents in any building in L.A. A tall claim, but to us, it is true. Our residents really complete the experience of living in this wonderful, village neighborhood.DetailsAvailability date: TodayPets: Cats, Small Dogs (< 25lb)Pet notes: Deposit: $500.00 TO $600.00Leasing options: Leasing notes: NoneApplication fee: $49.12 PER ADULTAmenitiesIncluded in Utilities Cost: Utilities Cost: Laundry: SharedParking type: Covered Parking notes: Appliances: Dishwasher, Refrigerator, Microwave, Range/OvenExterior: Private pool, Balcony/patio, Rooftop DeckHeating/cooling: Central AC, Air conditioningWiring: Facilities and Recreation: Fitness center, Heated PoolSecurity and Access: Elevator, Security system, Controlled access, Gated entryViews: City, MountainAdditional features: Hardwood floor, Hot tub / SpaOffered by:Vue Los FelizEqual Housing Opportunity
