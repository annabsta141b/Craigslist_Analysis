Live Grand
This is a 1 Bedroom, 1 Bath, approximately 547-645 Sq. Ft. 
Eighth & Grand is the kind of exciting lifestyle destination that Downtown Los Angeles has been waiting for. Here you'll find the neighborhood's first Whole Foods Market®, the kinds of services and amenities normally reserved for full-service offerings, and a curated members club that delivers the best of urban culture. With spaces designed by studio Commune, authors of the Ace Hotel DTLA interiors, Eighth & Grand blurs the lines between modern, historic and classic. From the surface-mounted lights to the Bauhaus-inspired hardware, this design is fresh, unexpected and timeless.
