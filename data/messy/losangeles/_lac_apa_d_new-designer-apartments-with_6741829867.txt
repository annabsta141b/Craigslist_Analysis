EL CENTRO BRINGS DARING NEW LIFE INTO GRAND OLD HOLLYWOOD  El Centro Apartments & Bungalows is a vibrant new residential rental community offering the best of city living in central Hollywood. Steps away from the legendary intersection of Hollywood and Vine (and the Metro station), the property offers a range of smart and flexible layouts to suit every personality. Studios, lofts, bungalows, penthouses, and classic one- and two-bedroom apartments are available.Acclaimed L.A.-based creative collective Commune Design created El Centro's thoughtfully crafted interiors to feature large windows, high ceilings, walk-in closets, and honed surfaces that aren't too shiny.The urbane El Centro lifestyle centers on the pool, lounge, yoga studio, spa, and fitness center. Passageways and courtyards burst with drought-sensitive landscaping of exotic palms, wild succulents, and specimen cacti from L.A.'s Cactus Store.The project's name, by the way, comes from El Centro Avenue. Going back much further, the root word centrum originally meant the fixed point around which you draw a circle--the middle of it all.With its center-of-everything location, El Centro Apartments & Bungalows is designed to be your new walkable, car-optional, app-enabled, indoor/outdoor, live-work home in the city.CalDRE LIC #00838846  Call Now:  show contact info
