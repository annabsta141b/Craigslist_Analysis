Beautiful studio available mid October with stunning views of downtown, roof top pool and gym. Many amenities such as dishwasher, large windows, onsite doorman, onsite laundry, great Financial district location at 8th and Flower. I've updated photos of the rooftop pool and pics of my furniture to give a sense of size (this unit is unfurnished).
I moved out October 9th and paid $2250 for rent and one parking spot, contact Gas Company Lofts leasing office for exact price and availability!
