Super fab location! Midtown Shopping Center is literally across the street. Ralphs, Jamba Juice, Yogurtland , Living Spaces and Planet Fitness -- to name only a few -- are ridiculously close to home.   So many chill spots and awesome eats!   Our faves:  the amazing pour-over coffee at Paper or Plastik - delicious organic lunch at Bloom or My 2 Cents - just minutes away.
Convenient! You're in the middle of it all at this location - get to Culver City in 10 min and Santa Monica in 20! Cruise up San Vincente to WeHo is a flash.  Hollywood and Dtla? Easy breezy!
