She's got the house, the car, the dog, AND you're paying alimony?  How'd you like to have a little cash left over at the end of the month?  Maybe enough to eat something besides frozen pizza?  I'm slashing the rent on this unit to 1450, so jump in now while you've got the chance.
Look at what were offering; a spacious one bedroom apartment with New carpet and New flooring! Close to restaurants, Universal City, and the 170 freeway
