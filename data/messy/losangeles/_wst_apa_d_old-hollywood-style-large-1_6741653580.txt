Boasting a giant living room and full size dining room, this charming Spanish-revival unit is located in the most desirable part of Downtown Culver City. The Arclight Theatres and the night life of Main St. are literally at the end of your street but the neighborhood manages to stay quiet. Trader Joe's is just a couple blocks over.
New flooring and high ceilings throughout add drama to the space. Completely remodeled kitchen and bathroom. A great make-up/shaving counter makes getting ready fun and easy.
An ideal area for weekend walks with a friend or your dog, location is central to world class dining, 1.5 blocks from movie theatres, farmers market, and much much more. 
Within walking distance:
-Trader Joe's
