Beautiful apartment. Amazing location.
Located right off of Barrington and Santa Monica, directly in the middle of a great Westside neighborhood, its an easy walk to shopping, dining, and the vibrant LA nightlife. Easy access to public transport and the 10 and 405 freeways also!
The living room features sleek hardwood floors and epic high ceilings. Lots natural light pours through the tall windows during the day. Features a convenient half bath for hosting guests as well, and plenty of wall space. The kitchen is MASSIVE. Lots of counter top space combined with tons of cabinets, and fully stocked with all of the appliances: a fridge, stove, oven, microwave, and a dishwasher. Upstairs you find the bedrooms: nice and bright, roomy, and no shared walls! Each bedroom also comes with its own full bathroom.
