Hello! We are a couple looking for one roommate to rent the second bedroom in our 2 bed/2 bath apartment! The room is unfurnished, spacious, has hardwood floors, and you basically have your own bathroom since we share the one in the master bedroom. Our building is located half a block from the beach on Westminster Ave. 
Rent for the room is $1350 and will be month to month. Utilities are not included and usually run around $70/month, split between the 3 of us. Unfortunately, no dogs or cats allowed. $1350 security deposit. 
About us: I'm a 26 year old recent UCLA grad, majored in Geography/Environmental Studies, and at the moment I work as a freelancer in the event industry. My boyfriend is 34, works full time and is working on a masters degree, loves to surf, ride his motorcycle, and be outdoors. We also have a 5 yr old African tortoise named Sheldon who is very sweet/mellow and doesn't bite! We're hoping to find a roommate in their mid 20's-30's. Someone who is kind, respectful, responsible, clean, and easy going. 
*Room is available starting December 1. Only looking for one roommate! Text/email me if interested and include a little bit about yourself (name, age, what you do, etc.) I look forward to hearing from you  :)
