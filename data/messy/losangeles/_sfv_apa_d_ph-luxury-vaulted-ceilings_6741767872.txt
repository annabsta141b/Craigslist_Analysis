	This spacious 2 bedroom will be available at the end of this month. Our apartment homes rent out quickly. Enjoy coming home to a fully equipped kitchen with ample cabinetry and cooking space. Don't worry about dirtying clothes. The washer and dryer is included. 
	At Academy Village, we know that your pets are more than furry friends- they are family! We do not have weight restrictions with dogs, so bring your Great Danes and chunky Labradors. We have a beautiful courtyard and a fantastic neighborhood for dog walking. Cats will love the natural light and private balcony in your apartment and will spend hours soaking in the sun. We provide the perfect home for you, Fido, and Fluffy!
