Description


This unit has been completely renovated! A fantastic property with new cabinets, granite counters, stainless steel appliances, new wall tile in both showers, new laminate plank flooring, all new lighting, all "cottage cheese removed". This location is phenomenal at the gateway to South Redondo - less than a mile to the beach on a cul de sac that backs up to Harkness Ave, a street with plenty of guest parking AND - the dog park across the street. 3D virtual walk-thru available. Includes internal stacked washer and dryer and two-car enclosed attached garage.


1322 Amethyst is a wonderful 4-unit building in a tract of similar properties.  Near employment hubs, transportation, excellent schools, shopping, and the beach.  All units are very spacious with ample parking. The front unit has a 2-car garage and the other three have one each.
