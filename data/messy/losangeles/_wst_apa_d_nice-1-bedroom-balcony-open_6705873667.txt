Very rare opportunity to rent this over sized one bedroom unit.  The entire unit has been freshly painted inside and out featuring granite counter-tops and laminate floors. This unit has ample storage including three closets plus a closet for linens.  There are plenty of kitchen cabinets as well. 
This quiet building is occupied mostly by professionals and hospital staff. The building offers laundry and gated underground parking. The pictures speak for themselves.
