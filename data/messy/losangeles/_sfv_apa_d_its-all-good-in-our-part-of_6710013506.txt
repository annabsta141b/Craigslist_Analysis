Some people think they know North Hollywood, but chances are they don't really know all the reasons that make it the right place for you to live.  When you consider the value, the quality, and the location, you'll see why "It's All Good!"
Spacious and handsome apartments overlooking a serene courtyard. It's a secure building with covered parking and the location is fantastic. . . Laurel Canyon shopping, restaurants, and the Valley Plaza Park; Library are super close. Easy access to the 170 Freeway means that Burbank, Universal City, and Downtown are just minutes away.
