This comfortable 7th floor condo is located right in the mix of Uptown. It is a 2BD/2BA unit that has room for roommates or even a young family. The unit is overlooking Grand Ave & Broadway so you can see the sights and sounds of Oakland (First Friday, The Great Wall, BANDALOOP [wall dancers!]). The home comes with an in-unit washer/dryer, dishwasher, ample closet space, additional storage, and parking for one car in the building's garage.
Uptown has a lot to offer with bars like Telegraph, Double Standard, Drake's Brewery and all the great cocktail bars near 19th St BART. It also has entertainment like the Fox theater, Paramount, New Parkway and movies by Lake Merritt. Venture out on the 1st Friday of any month and you'll find the vibrant city of Oakland alive and booming with street food, music, art and culture in an all evening party. When you're having friends over go out to eat at all the great restaurants & cafes like Gogi Time, Mua, Farley's East, Belly Burger, Smokin' Woods BBQ and more.
Transportation is simple: BART is a 5m walk to 19th St station or you can take the Transbay Bus which stops at the exact same spot. If you work where public transit is harder to come by, no problem, drive right onto the 880, 580, 80 and even the 24 within close distance from the home.
