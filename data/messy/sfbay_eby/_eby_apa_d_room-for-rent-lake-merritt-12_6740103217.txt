About me -
I work in the city M-F and leave my house around 6am and usually not home until 7pm. I rarely cook so the kitchen will most likely be all yours. Occasionally I work from home but I usually have travel plans every month so I'm not home much. I'm very easy going and get along with all personality types, enjoy going out with friends but like to keep my home a quiet sanctuary. Looking for someone to fill the room who is kind, respectful, and picks up after themselves. I may get a dog so you have to be comfortable living with a pet! Happy to send you my FB page so you know I'm a normal human.
