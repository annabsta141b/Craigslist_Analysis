Ever wanted to escape to a quiet farm, but still have all the cultural perks + amenities of a modern apartment in the city? Pick veggies from our farm garden, enjoy a lazy weekend in our wonderful backyard...all await you at Fossel Farm!
THE SPACE: Fossel Farm's fresh new rustic modern 1BR apartment sets a tone of simple refined elegance throughout. Using all natural materials and a design philosophy that less is often more, we have crafted this apartment by hand to our liking and are now excited to welcome new guests to enjoy it. We've used amazingly fragrant Tennessee cedar architecturally throughout with several full walls of wood and numerous built-in cupboards and closets. Our rustic modern 1BR is on the ground floor of the Fossel farmhouse and has one big sunny room on the South side for living, cooking, and eating and another on the darker North side for sleeping, along with a full bath of course. One enters into the living space and is greeted by a full wall of beautiful cedar with a small fireplace in the center. A Danish modern chair makes for a cozy arrangement by its side. To the right is the kitchen with its stainless steel appliances and Walnut countertops and further beyond the four person corner dining nook. To the left is the big bright bay window with a folding built-in cedar daybed surrounding it and a full wall of built-in cedar cupboards as well. The floors are Brazilian black slate, both practical and very handsome as well. On the ceiling are two walnut light fixtures and a vintage wooden propeller fan. The daybed has a cozy indigo mattress and an abundance of pillows that welcome you to relax there for the weekend with a book or use it as a cozy comfortable raised bed by night. Out the window you will be greeted by the shock of green growth that is our sideyard--or  if you come at the right time of year the window could be veritably filled with corn or sunflowers.
The kitchen on the north wall of the main living space has everything you need for a weekend or a week--as well as all the basics for a longer term stay. The cupboards are alder and treated with a natural stain from Oak galls by your hosts from their own formula. There is a 20"gourmet stainless steel stove, a stainless steel undercounter fridge, an industrial sink with sprayer, an espresso maker, a French press, a knifeblock, a dishrack, and a countertop composter.
THE HOUSE: The Fossel Farmhouse is an Edwardian style two level house, built in 1911, still a bit rough around the edges here and there in proper urban farm style, but resounds with charm from every corner! It underwent a renovation 20 years ago, with continuing improvements ever since, most of them handcrafted by your hosts. The exterior of the house is painted with great fresh colors. Shared laundry machines are at the back of the house in a greenhouse style laundry shed. The foundation is bolted and sheerwalled--very earthquake safe.
THE LOCATION: Right in the heart of the great little neighborhood of lower Shattuck Avenue just south of downtown Berkeley (where Shattuck goes down to 2 lanes), this house is 3 blocks to Ashby BART train station, and has a #18 bus stop right outside that takes you to either downtown Berkeley or Downtown Oakland. We are a 15-25 minute walk or 5-10 minute bike ride to the businesses and nightlife of all of the following: Downtown Berkeley, the Elmwood, Temescal, as well as CAL (UC Berkeley). 5 minutes driving to 24/580/880 freeway on-ramp. Walk score of 89. Great location!
THE NEIGHBORHOOD: The house is surrounded within a few blocks by local cafes (Nomad, Renaissance, Jumpin' Java), restaurants (Cafe La Pena, Smokey J's BBQ, Flaco's Taco's, etc), small loft developments, and a friendly neighborhood Irish pub (Starry Plough). Foodie favorites like Crixa Cakes, Sweet Adeline's Bakery, Emilia's Pizzeria, Easy Cajun, and Alchemy Collective are easy walking distance. Both Whole Foods and Berkeley Bowl, widely regarded as the best community market in the East Bay, are five blocks away. The neighborhood continues to develop rapidly with new restaurants and amenities opening all the time.
THE PARKING: The location offers plenty of long-term parking that's good for a week or more if you pay attention to the signs and avoid monthly or bimonthly street cleaning. Parking is 2 hours in front of the house, but only during the hours of 8am-6pm each day, so works easily for overnight parking. There is also a neighborhood parking permit that can be obtained for longer term parking in front of the house
THE PROPERTY: Our Edwardian Farmhouse sits on a large fully-fenced double lot with a generous front yard, huge backyard, and two side yards. There is a copper firepit on custom brick hearth, art studio (private), two outdoor eating spaces, kids area (with treehouse, sandbox, toys a plenty, chalkboard wall, mermaid and dragon), wood lounge chairs, handcrafted double red brick pizza oven with grill (in process), outdoor cafe lighting, lots of potted plants (succulents, aloe, orchids, bougainvillea etc), and three shade umbrellas for the tables. The property offers very nice indoor/outdoor living.
THE GARDENS: Fossel Farm's beautiful vegetable and dye plant gardens consist of 25+ raised beds (always changing but some usual food plant suspects: chard, kale, mixed greens, arugula, potatoes, tomatoes, basil, strawberries, beets, beans, edamame, rhubarb, onions etc). As one of your hosts is also an expert in plant dyes, we grow specialty dyes such as indigo and madder, as well as a range of other color producers. We have our Angora rabbit "bun bun", and keep two active beehives on top of our art studio/shed--out of harm's way--but great for those who may be interested.You can enjoy some seasonal vegetables from our garden and cook yourself a farm fresh egg or two while you're here. Currently the front yard features morning glory vines, a lemon tree, Neroli orange tree, false bamboo, roses, potato vine, as well as an expanding herb garden and a sitting area for two with brick patio. Lastly, there are four raised beds on the sidewalk with succulents and California poppies, as well as a peach and a walnut tree.
Fossel Farm has an active urban farm rhythm with lots of activity around the property, as well as your hosts' dynamic livelihoods that extend out into the local neighborhood and greater city beyond. There is most always one project or another going on, though most guests will find it very peaceful compared to staying nearly anywhere else in the Bay Area. It has a quietude and calm that resounds despite its urban location. When we are here as your hosts you may well see us frequently, particularly if you spend time in the gardens. If you want to retreat however we are just fine with that as well. It's what you make of it.
TERMS: Apartment available Jan 1st 2019. Rent is $3500 monthly, deposit is $3500. Looking for month-to-month or a lease that ends before summer 2019. It may be possible that we would extend the lease at that time however. We pay high speed internet, water, gas, electric, trash--you pay only rent. Fully furnished. 
SHOWINGS: Message me and we can set up an appointment. Serious inquiries only please.
Thanks!
