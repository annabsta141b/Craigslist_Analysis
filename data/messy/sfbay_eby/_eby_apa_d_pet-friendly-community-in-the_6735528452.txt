Description
  
    This large open-concept two-level 2 bedroom plus bonus room, 2 bathroom townhome features a bonus room great for use as a guest room, den, or office. The home is well lit and has beautiful modern dark gray wood-patterned luxury vinyl tile (LVT) floors; high ceilings; quadruple-pane windows; forced air conditioning and heating; a large deck with views of Point Richmond; and a full-size washer and gas dryer in the unit. The modern open kitchen has a Caesarstone quartz countertop and backsplash and stainless steel GE appliances including a gas range. The large bathroom has high-end finishes and a tub. The apartment is uber-efficient with a Navien tankless gas hot water heater, LED lighting, and spray foam insulation for superior sound insulation and temperature regulation. Parking for 1 car completes the home.
One of the reasons the Point is so special is its location within the small "downtown" of Point Richmond. At the same time, it is just minutes from Berkeley, Larkspur, and downtown San Francisco. Point Richmond is a gem, enjoying a historic small-town feel with quaint coffee shops, beaches, shops, restaurants, and even an old-fashioned barber.
