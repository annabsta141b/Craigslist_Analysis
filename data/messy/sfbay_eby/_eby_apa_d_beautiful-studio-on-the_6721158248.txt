This is a STUDIO apartment complex near BART and the UCB Campus. Located in a residential neighborhood, these studios provide the hustle and bustle of urban living without the hassle. There are dozens of shops a leisurely walk away, including the quintessential coffeehouses and cafes of Berkeley.
This lovely, classic 1920's mission-style apartment building is located at the border of Berkeley and North Oakland. The tall, three-paneled windows allow rays of natural light to shine into the apartment, illuminating the hardwood floors and the kitchen's beautiful woodwork and hardwood cabinets. These are extremely well-maintained, vintage, and spacious studios with a calm, peaceful ambiance for quiet living and enjoyment with excellent access to a beautiful courtyard.
AC transit bus stops are a block away on either side. The #18 bus runs down Shattuck for quick access to downtown Berkeley BART or to downtown Oakland. The transbay F line runs straight down Adeline/Martin Luther King Way and provides cheap and comparable travel time to San Francisco. Alternatively, Ashby BART, which offers access to the rest of the Bay Area, is four short blocks away.
