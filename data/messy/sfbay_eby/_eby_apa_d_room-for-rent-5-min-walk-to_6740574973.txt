Hi there,
We have a room available in our 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment starting Dec 1st. We would rather have a quality roommate, then rush - therefore we would be willing to work with you for a later move in date if you are a good fit... We are looking for a someone in their late twenties - early thirties. No couples or kids.... 1 person only! 1-year lease. The rent is $960 and utilities run around $40 a month. There is a deposit of $333 that needs to be paid before move in. You must have good credit and steady income ðŸ˜Š. 
We are looking for a drama-free, FT employed roommate. We like to keep the common areas (kitchen, bath, and living room) clean and are respectful of each other's space and belongings. You would share a bathroom with one of the roommates. We don't have big parties but love to have friends over for dinner and game nights, and of course binge watching our fav shows. 
We are located on the 1st floor of a 5 plex building in downtown San Leandro. 5 min walk to San Leandro BART, short distance to Safeway, coffee shops, and tons of restaurants. Our complex is safe and quiet, there is laundry onsite with parking on the street. The room is medium size and is furnished, but if you have your own furniture I can have the furniture removed (we have been using it as a guest room). Lastly, no pets unfortunately they're not allowed.
Roommates:

1.	Tell us about yourself ðŸ˜Š
2.	What's your daily routine? (ex. wake up / go to bed)
