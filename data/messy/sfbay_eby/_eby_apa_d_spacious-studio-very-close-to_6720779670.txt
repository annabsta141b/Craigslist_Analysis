I look for someone who can take my sublease. There is a spacious and unfurnished studio that next to the campus within about half block, and this location is super convenient to access the campus and Downtown Berkeley. It is twice as huge as a normal studio, so it very comfortable for 2 persons. my lease will end in May 2019.  1-year lease only,  Deposit is one month rent. All utilities including except network. Garage parking for extra $100 per month. No smoking, No pets.
