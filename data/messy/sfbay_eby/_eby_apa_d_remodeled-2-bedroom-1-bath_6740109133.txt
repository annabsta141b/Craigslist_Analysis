Very nicely remodeled 2 bedroom in a great area.  This is an upstairs corner unit in a 10 unit complex.
The property is right in the middle of Emeryville.  You can walk or bike easily to everywhere in the city.
The previous tenants told me they loved the unit and location.  They decided to pursue a more lucrative position out of state.
The unit includes a full kitchen with a 5 burner gas range.  The living room is spacious. There are four closets.  All of the windows look out into city maintained open space.  From the patio window you can see the local community park. It's a beautiful unit.
