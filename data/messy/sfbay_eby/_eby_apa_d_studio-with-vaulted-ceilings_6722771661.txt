This is an absolutely charming studio apartment located 2 blocks up the street from the Berkeley Bowl. It is a retreat from the hustle and bustle of city life, but only a 10 minute walk from Ashby BART. If you commute to San Francisco, or take the Facebook or Google bus to Silicon Valley, this is the place for you!
You'll never have a problem parking, because the property is located across the street from the back side of an elementary school. It has a private backyard entrance, a large main room with a vaulted ceiling, and westward-facing windows that lets in lots of light and offer gorgeous views.
The studio has all gas appliances including a new stove, new carpet in the living room, and a new kitchen floor.
It's officially available November 1, but if you need to move in earlier, that might be possible.
If this sounds like home to you, please email me (Chuck) via the link. Open house Sunday from 2:00 - 3:00.
