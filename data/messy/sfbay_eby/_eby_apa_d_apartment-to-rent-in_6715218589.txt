Some of the amenities are:
Covered parking
Big balcony
Garden/park-like areas around and in-between units
Laundry facility
Tenant responsible for Utilities except for water & garbage.
Right now we have a 2bdr/ 1bath available.  This unit is much desired.  Applicants will be reviewed in order that they are received.
