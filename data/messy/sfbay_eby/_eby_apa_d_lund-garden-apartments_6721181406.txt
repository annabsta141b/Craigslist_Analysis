Description
 We are pleased to offer this spacious Junior 1bd apartment, the biggest in Hayward. Everything has been updated including the bathroom and kitchen, with new granite counter tops and hardwood floors. The apartment is inviting and quiet, a great place to call home!

Welcome to Lund Garden Apartments. We are nestled between the SF Bay and the East Bay Foothills. We are minutes from I-580, I-880, the San Mateo Bridge, and Cal State East Bay. The Hayward BART station is six minutes away and we are completely surrounded by shopping and other basic services. Despite great access to everything you want and need, our quiet dead-end street contributes to Lund Garden Apartments being one of Hayward's best kept secrets. Don't delay. These unit will not last.
