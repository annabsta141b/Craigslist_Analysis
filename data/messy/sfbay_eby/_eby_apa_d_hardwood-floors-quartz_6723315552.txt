If you hate nice kitchens, do not rent this apartment! However, if you would love to have an upscale kitchen without paying $3,000 rent, we have you covered. 21 cu ft Samsung fridge, GE Adora range and Profile built-in microwave, Bosch dishwasher.
We are still completing the apartment, so these pictures will be updated. For example; as we install the microwave and complete painting and flooring over the next few days.
Beautiful 1-bedroom apartment with high ceilings, nice light, and Victorian-deco styling. We are in a good Oakland neighborhood near the Emeryville border, a quick hop to restaurants, shopping and the Bay Bridge. There is a secluded backyard, and a laundry on the premises. The apartment has been well maintained and includes newly refinished hardwood floors, a bathtub-shower and an amazing kitchen. The kitchen has just been remodeled with quartz counter tops, new cabinets and all new stainless appliances including dishwasher and over-the-range microwave. This is truly a chef's kitchen!
Close to restaurants and movie theaters, waterfront park/marinas and shops; including IKEA, Trader Joe's, Best Buy and the new Bay Street Shopping Community.
No smoking or late-night noise. Tenants pay their own PG&E. Rent is $1750, with a $1300 security deposit. We require a one-year lease with a standard rental application, credit report verification and references.
The apartment will be available for viewing this Saturday and Sunday, Oct 20-21, by appointment. Drop me an email, with a few words about yourself. The apartment will be ready for move-in next week. Thanks, Dan
