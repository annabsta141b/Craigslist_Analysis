Hello,
My husband, our dog, and I have been living in this apartment for a little over 2 years. We really love it here. It has plenty of space for us and sits in a quiet and very pleasant neighborhood. 
Parking is easy -  we both have cars and it's never been an issue. The apartment comes with 1 dedicated spot, a few first-come-first-serve spots, and off-street parking available if those get full. Neighbors in the complex are very friendly. It's within walking distance to a gym, movie theater, restaurants, pharmacy, dry cleaners, and more. It has an air conditioner, dishwasher, and washer/dryer all in-unit. It would come unfurnished. 
We have a lease that ends on 3/31/19, however, are moving out of the Bay Area on Thanksgiving. We are looking to terminate our lease early and find someone else interested in living here ~ Dec 1st, 2018 (later start dates welcome). If you're interested, send us an email and we'll show it to you. If you're still interested, we'll put you in touch with our landlord to work out details and go through the regular application process. 
Thank you,
Nicole
