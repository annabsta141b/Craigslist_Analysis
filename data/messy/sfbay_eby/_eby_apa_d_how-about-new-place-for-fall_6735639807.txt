Some of our newer upgrades come with all new wood inspired flooring. All apartments include modern electric appliances...stove with self cleaning oven, dishwasher and refrigerator. All units have lots of cabinet and storage space...five LARGE closets.....two in the hallway that are side by side, with beautiful white inset panel doors...From your balcony, patio or or deck, there are plenty of mature pistachio and ash trees, and many with breathtaking views of Mt. Diablo....then nearby, is your own designated covered parking space.
