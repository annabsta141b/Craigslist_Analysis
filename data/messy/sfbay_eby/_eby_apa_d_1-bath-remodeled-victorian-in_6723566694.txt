We have a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom unit now available.  New carpet and pad throughout. Upgrades throughout. Kitchen has a dishwasher.  The unit is about 1000 sq ft.  There is a small deck off the kitchen for a table and BBQ. This is the upper unit with lovely views over the town. The unit is Victorian styling throughout with loving mouldings, slider doors, double-hung windows, etc- really charming. 
Laundry room onsite- washing machine and dryer are owned by the lower tenants who share with your unit. There is no off-street parking or garage, but street parking is plentiful.  This building is well-cared for and the area is very safe.
Rent is $2800 (which includes your PG&E); security deposit is $3000.  Landlord also pays water and garbage.  Credit check is $20 for each adult.  One year lease preferred but shorter terms considered.  Pets generally accepted. The lower tenant has a small dog.
Point Richmond is a lovely community with easy access to Marin and San Rafael, Berkeley and San Francisco.  From this apartment, you can easily walk downtown to the market or post office, or you can walk over the hill to the water.
