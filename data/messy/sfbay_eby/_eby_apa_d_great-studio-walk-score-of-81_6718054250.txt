This gated community features a central location, gorgeous remodeled apartment homes in a quiet and peaceful environment. Hardwood floors immediately signal luxury and comfort, large double pane windows, granite counter tops and stainless appliances.
The Clinton neighborhood is one of Oakland's best kept secrets. It is close to everything, quiet at night and genuinely a mixture of all lifestyles. It is home to several excellent neighborhood restaurants and Oakland's best taco trucks are also nearby.
We feature clean on-site laundry facilities, your choice of FIBER OPTIC or DSL internet, bicycle parking racks, barbecue area in a courtyard setting. On-site management and maintenance staff for your convenience. Assigned covered off-street parking in our gated courtyard is available and individual garages are offered for an additional fee.
We have a bus stop for AC Transit right across the street (bus line 14 and 40), or a 15 minute walk to Lake Merritt BART and easy access to 880 and 580.
