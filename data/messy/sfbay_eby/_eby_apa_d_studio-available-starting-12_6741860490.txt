MUST HAVE UC BERKELEY ID (apartment rules)
Looking for someone to take over my lease starting 12/1 for a studio apartment near UC Berkeley. 
$485 per month (yes, really). 10 min walking from UC Berkeley campus and 15 min from downtown BART. Lease ends on June 2019 and can be renewed. 
One bathroom will be shared between you and two people in a suite arrangement. Rent includes utilities: gas, electricity, water, garbage (also comes with toilet paper).
No kitchen available, but I have a makeshift one and it works great. 
Email me for any questions, more info, and to set up a time to come see the room.
