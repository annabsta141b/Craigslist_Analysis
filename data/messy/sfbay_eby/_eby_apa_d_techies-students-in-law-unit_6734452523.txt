Have an In-Law Unit Available January 1st. It's a 520 sq foot apartment, 2 bedroom, 1 bath, full kitchen with washer/dryer in the unit. It's entirely separate from the house which is built above it and has a private entrance. Has a state of the art security system, your own heating system and is overall a really nice place to live. I have over 30 reviews on AirBnb, which are all 5 star reviews so client feedback has been really great. 
It is currently furnished, but can be un-furnished depending on your needs. 
Looking for cool people who are not big partiers as the home is above a house. Ideal for a young couple getting started, graduate student in need of quiet place to live, or two young working professionals who are roomies to share a space and cut their cost of living down.
Rules: No pets, or smoking (smoke outside please if you must) 
Need first, last months and a deposit to move in. 
Lease Terms: till mid August. 
If you're interested please respond back with a short intro about yourself, and links to your social media accounts so I can check that you're a good candidate.
