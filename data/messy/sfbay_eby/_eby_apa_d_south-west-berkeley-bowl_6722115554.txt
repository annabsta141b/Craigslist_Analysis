It is 5 minutes away from the Berkeley Bowl west, which is arguably the best grocery store in the area, if not the whole US... We enjoy the convenience of getting the best food available that is so close to us. 10 minutes away from the Bay Bridge, all major stores (home depot, Ikea, best buy, Emeryville shopping and entertaining) are all within 10 minutes radiance.  
Please tell us a bit about yourself to set up appointment to see the space. 1 year lease and month to month after. We enjoy living here and hope you do too!
