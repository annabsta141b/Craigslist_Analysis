Private Bedroom and Bathroom available in November. 
I'm a F in my late 20's looking for a F in her late 20's to late 30's to sign into a new 1 year lease. Quiet and clean in the common areas.
Street parking. 
I do have a small (8lb) dog that is hypoallergenic so she does not shed at all and she is only in my room when I'm not home but no other pets please. 
The common areas of the apartment are furnished but the bedroom and bathroom you would be renting are not.
The room is 9x11 with a 6ft window on the smaller wall and a huge closet along the entire bigger wall. 
It is a non smoking apartment under contract and no grilling on the balcony. 
Coin operated laundry is in the building. 
rent is $1125 + $60 for internet and electric 
security deposit is $1100
$2285 for move in
