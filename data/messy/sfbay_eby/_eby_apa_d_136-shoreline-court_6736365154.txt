Lovely one bedroom, one bath condo with a spacious loft in The Shores. This is one of the most UNIQUE and RARE condos at The Shores: it has a water view off the private balcony. Picture yourself with a glass of wine, watching the sun set over the bay. 1136 Shoreline Court is a lovely, light-filled upstairs unit with a wood burning fireplace, with the prettiest views and nicest light you'll only find in an upstairs unit. The Shores is a gated community with fantastic amenities: two community pools, a full gym and a clubhouse. Centrally located for a convenient commute through the East Bay, San Francisco and Marin County. Direct ferry service to Marin and SF is projected to be completed in November of 2018. Miles of gorgeous Bay Trail coastline just outside your doorstep to enjoy!
