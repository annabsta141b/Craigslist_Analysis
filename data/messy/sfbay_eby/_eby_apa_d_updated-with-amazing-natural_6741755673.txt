	With vaulted ceilings, a unique fireplace, and private garage you will be so happy to call this your next home. Our Evergreen floor plan is unlike any other. Two spacious bedrooms and two large bathrooms make living a breeze; not to mention the fresh air and sunlight that comes pouring in through our over-sized windows, and large sliding door that leads directly to your private balcony.
	Wood Creek isn't your typical apartment complex. Our community offers a forest of trees and several water features designed with your comfort in mind. Why live on a busy road when you can watch ducks swim by instead? Call today for a better tomorrow.
