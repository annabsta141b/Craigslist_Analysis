Spacious and charming 1 bedroom apartment in Adams Point available on 11/1.  $2200, all utilities included.
A 2 month commitment is asked until 1/1/19, then it will be a month to month sublease. Single people are preferred, though couples welcome to apply if you are quiet. 
The apartment is nicely furnished with lots of light from the front windows. Fully stocked kitchen with all the cooking equipment you would need. Washer/Dryer in basement. I have some belongings (mostly clothes and books) in the apartment, but you would have plenty of space in the closet and drawer space. 
Please note that the dining table is no longer in the apartment. It did not fit right, so I replaced it with a small 2 person high table that is cute and works nicely with the space. 
Adams Point is one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Oakland- it is highly walkable, only 8 minutes to Lake Merritt and just a little further to the Saturday Farmers Market, Grand Lake Theatre, restaurants and cafes. Approximately 20 minute walk to the 19th Street BART. About 8 minutes to the closest casual carpool pick-up. 
Please contact me for serious inquiries. I am looking for a quiet, mature professional person who does not party (a few friends for dinner is okay). Single people highly preferred.
