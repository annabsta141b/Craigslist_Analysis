Cozy studio apartment. Located in the quiet Orinda town, perfect for those looking for a functional and close proximity to BART (less than 1-mile walking distance) home. 
The stylish apartment is approximately 260 sq feet and can comfortably accommodate up to 1 tenant. It is found on the 2nd floor of an elegant, Italian style building with a private entrance. The cozy studio consists of a full bathroom, closet space, main area and a small kitchenette area. Last but not least, the house is surrounded by trees and is very quiet and perfect for someone who is looking to escape from the city noise but has easy access to the major public transport, BART. Perfect neighborhood for hiking, walking distance to coffee shops, stores, movie theatre.
This is real listing. I am busy working (~12 working hours  + commute) professional so sometimes it takes up to a day or so until I am able to respond.
