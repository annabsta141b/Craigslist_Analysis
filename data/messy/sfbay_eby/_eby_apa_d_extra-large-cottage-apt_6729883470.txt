Our property features extremely SPACIOUS Garden Apartments surrounding a beautifully landscaped courtyard and lawns in a small charming 29-unit gated complex. This lovely single-story cottage has a modern open floorplan featuring a gourmet size kitchen with energy-saving Kenmore appliances, a spacious dining area with a ceiling fan, a HUGE 20 by 18 foot living room with plenty of room for that large screen HDTV, central heat and air, decorator window coverings and a spacious patio. There are no hidden costs. This means no charge for water, garbage and sewer [for occupancies of 4 or less]. Deposit is only $1,100. We are located in a quiet residential neighborhood with schools for all grade levels (including the new Academy for International Studies and the 'award winning' Public Safety Academy), bus lines, Solano Mall, I-80, and Travis AFB all nearby.  There is also a large variety of shops and restaurants within walking distance as well as a Super-Walmart and Planet Fitness.
