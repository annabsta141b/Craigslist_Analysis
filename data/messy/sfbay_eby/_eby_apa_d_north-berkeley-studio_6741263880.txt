Le Conte Walk Apartments 


2541-2555 Le Conte Ave


Berkeley, CA 94709


 




 


2555 Le Conte Ave is a 29-unit complex offering a mix of studios, one- and two-bedroom apartments. This unique architectural building features a very unique layout, resulting in the units being tucked away from the street. Some units have exposed brick, high ceilings or rustic wood beams; others have private decks or balconies ideal for a quiet moment or a book you've been meaning to finish. The majority of the Le Conte Walk Apartments are super spacious with hardwood floors and outstanding architectural design and nestled in the beautiful North Berkeley Hills. The complex has a huge gated parking structure with ample off-street parking, an on-site laundry room with multiple machines, bike parking and a phone intercom system.




Neighborhood Information

Neighborhood Description:


The Le Conte Walk Apartments is perfect for someone who wants to be centrally located and super close to UC Berkeley on the highly desirable north side of campus. The UC Berkeley campus and the engineering building are only one-half block away. The North Berkeley tends
to attract graduate students, university faculty, and Berkeley residents, especially engineering students. It is a quiet, quaint neighborhood with tree lined-streets surrounded by lush landscaping.


Downtown Berkeley, BART and the Gourmet Ghetto are just a 5-minute walk away and the UC Berkeley Campus is just a 2-minute walk. Just down the street are the Holy Hill Institutions and the Graduate Theological Union. The infamous Greek Theater is just a 5 minute walk away where each spring and summer, bands from all over the world come to play. The location is just one block to the great shops on Euclid Avenue where you can easily grab a great cup of coffee at one of the numerous coffee houses in route to the campus. Great restaurants and cafes include Bongo Burger, La Val's Pizza, Northside Cafe, Hummingbird Cafe, and Celia's Mexican Restaurant. 


Note:


The contract rent will be adjusted by an additional 1.8% as it is subject to
Measure U1, which was adopted by voters in 2017. This increased rent
shall be used to support Berkeley's Affordable Housing Trust Fund (AHTF).
