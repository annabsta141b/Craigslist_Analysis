The house is a 15 minute walk from the Fox Theater, The Uptown, first Friday art walk and all that funness in downtown Oakland. Easy street parking. Quick accesses to the 880, about a 15 minute drive to San Francisco. Your neighbors, the tenants upstairs, have lived in the building for over four years. All very pleasant professional young men, you will be sharing the back yard with them (although they it seems they don't spend any time in it so it's mostly yours). 
If you're interested I'm looking for down to earth folks who'll be respectful to the neighbors. I can't accommodate pets I'm afraid. Please also be non-smokers, drug free and willing to apply for renters insurance.
Rent: $2375 per month ( includes storage unit and garbage -- you are responsible for electricity, gas and water)
Move in costs: first and deposit. Total cost: $4750
Move in date: November 1st (possibility of an earlier move in date) 
Please reply with a little about yourself and don't forget to provide a contact number. I look forward to chatting with you and showing the place : )
Thanks!
(The block is a true expression of West Oakland, a real mix of all types of people - there are a few street walkers and a liquor store on the corner. No tenants have ever had a problem in the 7 years that I've had the house but I'd rather be honest with you than paint a picture of a perfect neighborhood (as much as I'd love you to move in!) 
Additional notes about the application process:
The application fee is $30 per applicant.
Please also be prepared to provide:
- 2 months of recent bank statements
- Paystubs for the last 2 pay periods
- 2 references from previous landlords 
This all seems a bit much I know! But is a necessary evil I'm afraid
