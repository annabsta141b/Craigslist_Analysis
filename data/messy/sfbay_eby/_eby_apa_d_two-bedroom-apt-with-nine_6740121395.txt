 Property Description  Come home to luxury every day by choosing this two-bedroom, two-bathroom floor plan available at the beautiful park-like community of Amador Lakes. Nine-foot ceilings create a bigger, airier interior. Even with the abundance of space, central heat and air conditioning and a wood-burning fireplace keep the home cozy. In select apartments, designer two-tone paint and vaulted ceilings add more sophistication. Remodeled homes also include tile kitchen and bathroom floors, granite countertops, and upgraded cabinets. While fully equipped kitchens come standard, renovated apartments offer stainless steel appliances. Roomy closets and full-size washers and dryers are also available. This plan provides you a private patio or deck to enjoy, but for the complete Amador Lakes experience, step outside and take in the stunning views of the community's lakes and fountains. Pools, spas, and tennis courts await you. With Iron Horse Trail close by, you can enjoy walks with your pets. Call now!
