Details About This Property:


A lovely little slice of the good life just at the corner of Spruce and Santa Barbara Rd. Bus stops rights out front for immediate access to downtown. Washer and dryer in unit, front porch, kitchen with 24in gas stove, full bathroom and small but totally comfy back bedroom with built in closet. This apartment has some design features that are odd as it was built out to be an in-law, so some of the fixtures are a bit dated, but the living room is the star of the show. It's got that cool old Berkeley thing going for it and the price is right, not to mention this is a world class neighborhood with views of the bay- HUGE BAY VIEW DECK ON TOP OF HOUSE FOR YOU TO HANG OUT ON! 

Details About The Neighborhood:
You can walk to shopping at great places right on Solano Ave! If you're looking for a great place to live in a good part of town, this could be your place! Take a walk to Peet's Coffee on Sunday morning or or just hop on your bike for a ride around the scenic areas of this great scenic district It's all here for you!
