Hearst Garden Apartments
1246 Hearst Ave
Berkeley, CA 94702 


 Great news!  This particular unit is coming available during our "off season" because of a lease-break.  The former residents were actually paying the value of $2845 per month, which was the market rent at the time they moved in this past June.  However, due to the fact that they need to break their lease during the "off season", where transition in the rental market is a bit slower, this unit is probably not going to rent at $2845.  The former residents understand this and in an effort to get the unit rented as quickly as possible, have agreed to a $200 buy down on the rent. 
What does this mean? The outgoing residents who need to break their lease will pay the new residents $200 for each month until the original term of their lease expires on 7/31/19.  (For example, if this unit rented on November 1, the former residents will write a check for $200 x 9 months (Nov-July) for a total of $1800.)
How much rent will you pay?  The new residents will continue paying $2845/month to Premium Properties but after they sign their lease, they will get a check from the former residents for $1800.  Essentially, this makes the actual rent they are paying $2645 until 7/31/19. 
Why would you take this deal? This is a great opportunity for anyone to take advantage of the Winter Off Season as they get a well maintained, spacious unit for under the market rent.

A great centrally located neighborhood with easy access to all forms of 
public transportation. There's been quite a renaissance lately in this

such as Pizza Moda. If you like to cook at home, you can shop
close by at Trader Joe's, or take a short ride to Berkeley Bowl West. 
Commuters and students alike will find BART running to San Francisco and
back regularly from North Berkeley, Ashby and Downtown stations. For
