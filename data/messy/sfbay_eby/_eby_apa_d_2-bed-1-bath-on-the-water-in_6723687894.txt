FOR SALE: 30ft S2 sailboat for $16,500. She's in great shape and makes for the perfect way to entertain friends on the water or escape the Bay Area's outrageous housing prices by living aboard ($340 / month to berth in Alameda). 
The entire interior has been redone to make this a fantastic place to entertain or live. Flat screen and AppleTV installed and dock was wired for WiFi. Oven and 4 burner stove inside and grill above deck. Marina has fantastic laundry and shower facilities. I saved close to $15k in rent living aboard last year.
Ohh, and she sails wonderfully and is ready to take out our in bay on day one.
Text me if you are interested.
