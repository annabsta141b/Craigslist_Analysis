 Property Description  With the deluxe kitchen features available in this one-bedroom, one-bathroom floor plan at Park Wood, you will prepare meals in style! Picture yourself mastering culinary skills in a galley kitchen equipped with sleek stainless steel appliances, elegant quartz countertops, and solid-wood cabinets in white or maple finish. While the dining room offers an intimate setting for meals, the private patio or balcony off the living area provides an excellent spot for al fresco dining. Wooded views from select balconies create that treehouse feel, but if you want the full Park Wood experience, step outside and unwind in the community's solar-heated pool and spa or take your pets for a stroll at the adjacent Alamo Creek Park. You can also partake in the resident events the community regularly holds! Inquire now!
