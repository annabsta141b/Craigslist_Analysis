This well lit 1-bedroom apartment is on the second floor of a quiet, well-maintained 1920's building in a great neighborhood. High ceilings and hardwood floors throughout. Large windows let in lots of light. Bathroom with original tiles. Three large closets offer lots of space for storage.
Great downtown Berkeley location on McKinley Ave between Addison and Allston is close to downtown amenities but on a quiet street. Walk to BART, UC Berkeley, Trader Joe's, Target, Farmers Market, Gourmet Ghetto restaurants, and theaters. 
Rent includes water, hot water, heat, sewage, garbage, and recycling. One parking space is available for a very reasonable $50 per month.
Coin operated laundry on site. Unfurnished. No pets. No elevator. 
The lease is one year which then becomes month to month. The deposit is $2000. The apartment will be available November 1st or sooner. Apartments rarely become available at 2124 McKinley because of the coveted location and attractive living spaces.
Open house Wednesday 10/17 at 6:00pm. Please meet me outside at 2124 McKinley Ave. $15 application fee payable only by check. Applications available at the open house or beforehand upon request.
