Hanover Apartments 
350 Hanover Ave. 
Oakland, CA 94606 

Property Description: 


350 Hanover
is a 19-unit complex offering one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments. This building has recently been remodeled and is immaculately
maintained. Hanover features an elevator, making going in and out pleasant and easy.
The on-site laundry facility ensures you don't spend nights at a laundromat, and
off-street parking means you'll never have to circle the block hoping for a
spot.


Hanovers Apartments has a mix of cozy carpet, wood flooring and chic slate tile. Most units
have been remodeled with granite countertops, hardwood floors and new double-pane windows. The expansive living area is
enhanced by the large windows and sunny California light that they let in. You'll
find that the bedrooms are spacious, along with more than adequate closets.
Finally, we also have very conscientious resident managers that are there to
keep the common areas tidy and provide day-to-day servicing to the property.
