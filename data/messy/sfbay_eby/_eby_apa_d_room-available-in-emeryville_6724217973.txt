My friend and I just moved to the bay area and we are looking for another roommate. We found a place in Emeryville but work in the city. The commute is a short shuttle ride to BART and a short BART ride into San Francisco. The neighborhood includes a Safeway, restaurants, bars, and a mall. 
The apartment's amenities include:
24hr gym
Package cubbies
Hot tub
BBQs w/ picnic seating
Ground level and garage level parking*
In unit washer and dryer
The unit is a 4x2 and want to fill the private bedroom. Want to check it out?
