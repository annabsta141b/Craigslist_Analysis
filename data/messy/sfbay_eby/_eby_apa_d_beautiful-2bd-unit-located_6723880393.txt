Hearst Garden Apartments
1246 Hearst Ave
Berkeley, CA 94702 


Property Description:  

Hearst Garden Apartments is a 23-unit complex offering a mix of studios 
and 1-and-2 bedroom apartments. This beautiful complex set back off the 
street feels like a slice-of country, but is in the heart of Berkeley. 
The complex features 4 separate unique buildings from various 
architectural periods. Many units feature hardwood floors and remodeled 
kitchens with granite counters. These apartments have large living areas
and are set in a beautiful courtyard with gardens and off-street 
parking.


Neighborhood Information

Neighborhood Description:


A great centrally located neighborhood with easy access to all forms of 
public transportation. There's been quite a renaissance lately in this 
area which has resulted in many new and wonderful shops and restaurants 
such as Pizza Moda. If you like to cook at home, you can shop
close by at Trader Joe's, or take a short ride to Berkeley Bowl West. 
Commuters and students alike will find BART running to San Francisco and
back regularly from North Berkeley, Ashby and Downtown stations. For 
those of you who use ride-sharing services, you should experience 
reasonable rates to and from the UC Berkeley, your local workplace or 
neighboring areas with quick pick up times.


The Premium Difference: 


This property is professionally managed for premium service! That means that we are here to help with everything from maintenance in your unit to friendly personable customer service if you need something or have a question. This location offers the convenience of our online rent payment option as well. 


Note:


The contract rent will be adjusted by an additional 1.8% as it is subject to
Measure U1, which was adopted by voters in 2017. This increased rent
shall be used to support Berkeley's Affordable Housing Trust Fund (AHTF).
