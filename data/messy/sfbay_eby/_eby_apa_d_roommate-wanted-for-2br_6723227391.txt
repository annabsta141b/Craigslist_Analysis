Hello ... I'm looking for roommate to join forces and rent a 2BR apartment somewhere close to a bart station in Oakland or Berkeley. Preferred locations are 12th, 19th or Lake Merrit stations. Currently live in Walnut Creek and Commute to the city daily, ready to move in any time between now and December. 
A little about me. I'm an easy going guy, sociable, enjoy meeting new people and making friends. I'm clean and tidy and respectful of other people's space. I don't smoke, don't do drugs, and rarely drink at home. I enjoy reading, sports, checking new spots in town and comedy. Have a great job that keeps busy most of the week with frequent traveling. 
You have to be clean, responsible and communicate (as in talking and texting). Be ready to sign a lease for six months. I'm open to all genders, orientations, ethnicities .. etc. 
For questions feel free to text or email me for a chat and more details.
