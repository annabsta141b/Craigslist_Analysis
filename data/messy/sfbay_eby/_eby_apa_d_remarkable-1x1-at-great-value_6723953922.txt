The renovated units have plank flooring throughout with new carpet in the bedrooms, all new paint, upgraded lighting and plumbing fixtures, white shaker cabinets, countertops and stainless steel appliances.
Parc Medallion is located minutes from BART, shopping centers, restaurants and recreational attractions. Our community is close to major freeways, providing easy access for those commuting to and from San Francisco, San Jose and the Peninsula. 
When you arrive at Parc Medallion, scenic walkways guide you past a sparkling swimming pool and toward the expansive, garden-style apartments. Choose from a selection of NEWLY renovated one and two bedroom floor plans. 
Beyond your doorstep, Parc Medallion boasts several spaces for relaxation as well. Put on your bathing suit and soothe your muscles with a soak in the hot tub or enjoy a beverage at the outdoor lounge area. An on-site laundry center (which is currently being updated with new washers and dryers) allows you to wash your clothes without the hassle of leaving the community.
Parc Medallion knows that you do not want to spend all of your time cooped up inside, so the community is designed with you in mind. Play with your dog at our new community dog park or walk your four-legged friend along the well-kept paths to one of the open pet areas before meeting up with your neighbors, lounging at one of the picnic spaces or sunning beside the heated outdoor pool.
