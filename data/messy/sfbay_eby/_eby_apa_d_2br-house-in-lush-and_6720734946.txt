Description
  
    Fully renovated this year! 
Wonderful idyllic setting on unique lot. This 2BR/1BA house has a secure front and back yard, raised vegetable garden, natural wood floors. This home is part of a gated community of cute bungalows, unique remnants of times past, including a picturesque barn and antique fall out shelter, as well as verdant grounds and walkways. We hope the property will inspire a creative and artistic atmosphere for all who are lucky enough to call the Humboldt Gardens community home.
