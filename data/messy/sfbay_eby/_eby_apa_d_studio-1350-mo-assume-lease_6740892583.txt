Studio with kitchen and bathroom separate
Hardwood floor
Rent is $1350/mo
All utilities included on lease, including PG&E
When I was renting the studio, landlord told me 2 occupants are acceptable
Very convenient location. About 10 minute walk to San Leandro BART. Safeway, CVS, Post Office, plenty of places to eat, cleaners, all within 5 minute walk from studio.
Requirements:
-Landlord requires 3x rent monthly income
-Pay me out for deposit which is same as monthly rent. I will "forfeit" my deposit to you on paper. You're essentially reimbursing me and moving forward you will be responsible for deposit with landlord
-Good credit/rental history
-Very important house rule: no parties, keep the peace
I work Monday - Friday and get off work at 5PM and I have weekends off. If you'd like to discuss, please email me and we will exchange phone numbers after I verify you're real.
If you'd like to come and look at the apartment then we can work that out as well.
