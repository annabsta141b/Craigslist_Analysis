Description
  
    This charming, vintage styled apartment home is surrounded by the beauty that one would expect from a North Berkeley Neighborhood with immediate access to campus. Although the building is of classic architecture, the kitchen has been updated beautifully with quartz countertops, a modern faucet, beautifully stained wooden cabinetry, new refrigerator, micorwave and an electric stove. The natural light in this space is amazing as ample light is allowed to flood in due to a number of large bay windows throughout. There is a secured entrance, coin-op washers/dryers in neighboring building under the same management, and the tenant only pays electricity! 
The neighborhood is just east of the Gourmet Ghetto so one is never far from what is considered some of the best food in the Bay Area. Sporting an 83 Walk Score and 74 Bike Score, this neighborhood is ideal for any commuter. Also, if your commute is to UC Berkeley, this apartment is just steps away!
  *Open Houses: Tuesday, November 6th from 1-1:30pm*
