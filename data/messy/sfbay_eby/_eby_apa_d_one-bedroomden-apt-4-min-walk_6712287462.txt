I recently bought a house so I need to transfer my apartment lease over to a new tenant. The lease is through January 2019, and month to month after that.
Walnut Hill is an amazing apartment community with caring and supportive owners and gets 5-Star reviews on Yelp! https://www.yelp.com/biz/walnut-hill-apartments-walnut-creek
I am sad to leave, but happy to give this opportunity to someone new!
You can walk to BART and downtown's restaurants, bars and shops!
