Solano Stroll Apartments
1494 Solano Ave 
Albany, CA 94706

Property Description:


This 1960s era Mid-Century modern apartment complex features convenient access to Solano Ave just outside your front door. The building features a mix of 1-and-2 bedroom apartments, many of which have panoramic views of the beautiful surrounding Albany neighborhood. These units have incredibly large windows and tons of natural light. The entire building is in the process of being remodeled and updated to create a luxurious new feel. There is parking under the building for residents and plenty of surrounding street parking for your guests.

Currently, we have a one bedroom one bath apartment available on
the second floor.  Did we mention that all you have to do is step out of
your front door and you are right on Solano Avenue?! With tons of 
shops, dining, public transportation options and a bus line that runs 
along Solano Avenue this is also the ideal location for someone without a
car or looking to eliminate their commute and time wasted in traffic.

Neighborhood Information

Neighborhood Description:


Albany has been coined the "Urban Village by The Bay". Solano Ave and the surrounding area is arguably one of the most desirable places to live in the East Bay Area. Enjoy fine dining at famous Rivoli restaurant, or tasty BBQ at Bowl'd Korean Rice Bar or classic Mexican food at Gordo Taqueria. Catch public transportation to North Berkeley or El Cerrito BART or walk or bike there. Shopping is a breeze at Safeway right next door. There are also plenty of parks including Albany Memorial and the Albany Bulb. Last but not least, Albany is said to have one of the best public school systems in the entire Bay Area.
