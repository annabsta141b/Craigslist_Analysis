Our Fruitvale backyard studio apartment is available for rent, beginning Nov 1st! It's a small 1-bedroom/studio style space that's small but comfortable (for one person) and bright with a large bathroom (with shower stall) and tiny kitchen area (both are separate rooms from the main living/bedroom area). The kitchen is not great and is very very small, but it is functional with a small fridge and gas stove/oven. The unit has its own separate entrance, lots of light, nice quality laminate wood floors throughout, a very small built-in closet, fresh paint, gas heater and working appliances. Plenty of available street parking, access to large sunny backyard. No pets. No smoking of any kind. No couples -- this space is for one person only. Lightly furnished (i.e., existing double bed, table, kitchen island and lamp -- all flexible, depending on if you want them).  $1000 per month, plus $150 per month for utilities and wifi access  -- (so a total monthly rent of $1150 including utilities). One month's rent as deposit; rent due on the first of each month. We are a friendly, garden and justice loving family, with two young children, interested in building community. Please get in touch if you're interested!
