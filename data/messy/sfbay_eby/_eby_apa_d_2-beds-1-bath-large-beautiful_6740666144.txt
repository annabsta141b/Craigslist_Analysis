-This is a 3 unit building that is owned, lived in and maintained by a reputable Bay Area contractor, this is not your typical rental. There is 1 single person unit, this one you're looking at and we live upstairs with 2 kids, 7 and 10.
-You need to be comfortable with dogs, we have a few. Although they have their own yard, you'll need to walk by their fence to get to your place. All very friendly, but if you're not comfortable with dogs, this isn't the place for you.
WHO WOULD LIKE THIS UNIT
-If you're looking for a safe place, we have had very little crime up here. We are about 2 miles from 580 up Golf Links or 106th, the bad guys don't make it this far. Alarm system that sends texts out to whoever you program in if alarm goes off. It contracts the police and makes a lot of noise we will hear upstairs. It can be controlled via a smart phone or wall key pad. There almost always seems to be someone home so you're never alone. Just don't tell anyone how friendly the dogs are and trouble will steer clear of this place.
-Have kids? Look at the pictures of the backyard, they'll love it. Plus, the Zoo is just down the hill.
-Like the outside? You'll love walking along the paths in Knowland Park. Take a dog or 2 if you want company. Or, just hang out in the backyard.
WHO WOULD NOT BE A GOOD FIT
-If you're looking at the pictures and thinking a keg would fit nicely next to the fire pit while all your friends party until 2 am in the hot tub, I'm pretty sure the neighbors will put a stop to that before I do. 
-If you can't help but smoke inside (anything) this isn't the place for you. It makes it right through the floor to my kids upstairs. Not gonna work.
-It goes without saying, but I'll say it. Illegal drugs are not a good idea here with kids around.
