My boyfriend and I (25/22) have to be out of the room we rent by December 1st. Our roommate is moving out and we can't afford to rent the whole house ourselves. So if you're reading this and have a room to let/sublet please message me, too!
We are looking for a person or couple to split a 2 bed 2 bath apartment with in Vacaville! This is the one I found that I like so far, but we are open to suggestions as well. Budget is no more than $900, so total rent of apartment will be no more than $1800. Pets okay, except for cats (he's allergic). 420 friendly. Keep common areas clean. Please message me if you're interested in signing a lease with us! Tag your friends who might be!
