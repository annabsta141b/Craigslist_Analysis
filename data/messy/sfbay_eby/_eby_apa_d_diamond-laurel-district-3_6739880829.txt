Manager occupied apartment building located on 3084 Kansas St.  This is a small apartment building in a great neighborhood near I 580 and Fruitvale Bart Station.   Spacious 3 beds / 2 baths unit with own laundry room for rent.  Over 1600 sq feet.  This is not a small apartment unit by any means.   
What the unit includes:
Electric Stove
Electric Oven
Dishwasher
Washer and Dryer within the unit - is not communal!
A semi private backyard - myself and the other tenant rarely use the yard
I'm not going to up sale the place.  The unit will speak for itself once you see it.  I will disclose this is a 70 year old building so there are some wear and tear in the unit.  Overall it is still a great spacious place to live.  
Requirements:
Last 5 years of your employment history
Your credit report
A completed rental application
3 professional reference including your previous landlord
Deposit of $2500 and first month's rent when approved
I do not charge an application fee.  Unfortunately, I do not have time to make individual appointments during the week. Will hold open house on:
Sun, Nov 4 from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM
Sun, Nov 18 from 1 PM to 3 PM
If you have any questions, please contact me via email or  show contact info
