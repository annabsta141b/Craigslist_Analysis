Point Richmond is as safe as it gets
HIDDEN GEM: The people of Point Richmond are very serious about keeping it upscale, quiet and friendly. It has everything that Sausalito and Tiburon across the bay have, just better: The heel is more beautiful, ask the painters who come to Point Richmond to paint scenery that they sell all over the world, and not there. The air is better, cleaner. There are four parks, swimming beach, one of the best swimming pools, and a golf course that Sausalito and Tiburon do not have! Only the price is lower, but you get so much more if you care for a little fun without tourists noise!
