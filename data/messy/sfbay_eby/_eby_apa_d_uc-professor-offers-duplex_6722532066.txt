Garden Apt. with Apple and Lemon Trees.
Spacious 2 bedroom ground floor apt. with large, well-maintained back yard. French doors to garden. Residential neighborhood close to downtown and BART. 15 minute walk from UC Berkeley. 
Shown by appointment ONLY.
October to August 1 (or June 1).
Looking for quiet, responsible tenants. Two good-sized rooms and lots of living space. BBQ and outdoor table in the shared garden.
Utilities run about $100 a month.   I expect first and last month's rent, a $400 cleaning/damages deposit, and a signed agreement. 
ESPECIALLY important is that the tenants be quiet (ok to have parties, but my upstairs tenants are above your living room), responsible, and even kind! I am happy to consider undergrads at Cal. 
Contact me for address if you're truly interested, and tell me a little about yourselves.
