      This apartment is a fantastic value. It has many features, is large, and is in a very well cared for building convenient to Mills College, BART, 580 and 880.  There is a bus stop a few steps away.   
Many upgraded features and attention to detail make this a wonderful apartment.  The attractive full kitchen is beautiful with stainless appliances, tile flooring, a new gas stove, and we also included a built-in microwave. 
The full bathroom has a tub and shower combo, new vanity and lighting, and tiled floor.    
There are 2 closets (a big one in the bedroom, and a convenient linen closet in hallway).  There is rich, honey-toned new engineered wood flooring in living room and bedroom (see photos).
