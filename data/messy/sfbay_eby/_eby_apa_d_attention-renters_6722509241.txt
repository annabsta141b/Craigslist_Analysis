Most of your prices and too high for rent and you know it... Then you have the nerve to tell ppl no pets when MOST PPL HAVE THEM then wonder why your not able to rent it out... I've seen so many apartments and duplexs that's been on here for at least 3 months... You mean to tell me you still were not able to rent to anybody with your prices at 1300-1500 for a small ass studio that you wanted to put expensive stuff in there NOOOOOOOO omg whaaaaat? ðŸ˜‘ smh Good luck with renting and others plz vote yes on prop 10
