Top to Bottom Remodel Featuring:
1. All New Paint and Flooring.
2. All New Kitchen.
3. All New Bathroom.
4. All New Windows.
But the place also features some exceptional remodel touches:
1. New Doors Throughout - Including the Front and Rear Doors.
2. All New Stormdoors as well.
Perhaps the most unique feature of this place is how quiet it is. This is because of two major factors:
1. The unit is designed "townhouse style." That means that there is nobody above you and nobody below you. Living area is on the first floor, bedrooms and the bathroom are on the second floor.
2. Soundproofed Walls. Yes, you read that correctly. When the remodel was done, the owners pulled all of the sheetrock off the walls and installed soundproofing before putting on new sheetrock. So while the side walls are shared with another apartment, those walls are not only insulated but also had soundproofing added.
Building amenities include:
1. Off-street parking with an automatic gate.
2. Very large laundry room.
3. Shared backyard (currently being redone).
4. Quiet neighborhood across the street from an elementary school.
5. Southern exposure for all four apartments.
