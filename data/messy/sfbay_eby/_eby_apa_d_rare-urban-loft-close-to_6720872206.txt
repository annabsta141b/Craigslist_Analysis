Lampwork Lofts is where historic industrial meets contemporary living. A nationally designated historic landmark built in Oakland, CA in 1912, the masonry building was designed as an incandescent light bulb factory owned by General Electric, notable for being the first factory to employ women on the West Coast.
Now redefined and newly restored, Lampwork Lofts has 92 apartments for rent that will inspire you with open spaces soaring 14 to 25' high, original oak beam ceilings and exposed brick walls, and gorgeous windows with views of San Francisco and downtown Oakland. We hope to make Lampwork Lofts your new home.
