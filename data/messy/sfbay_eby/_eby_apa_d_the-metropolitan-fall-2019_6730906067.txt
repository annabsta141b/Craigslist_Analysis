The Metropolitan
The Metropolitan is a brand-new, privately-managed student housing community located one block from the UC Berkeley campus. Each student resident gets his or her own private bedroom in a suite shared with up to three other Cal students. Each suite is fully furnished and includes a bathroom, living room and kitchenette. The Metropolitan includes common kitchens with stainless steel appliances, game rooms, study lounges, a TV lounge, and a roof deck with a built-in barbecue and views of San Francisco.
Unlike a traditional apartment lease, residents at The Met are only responsible for their own rent and not for the rent of their suitemates. When applying for a single room, The Met leasing staff will assign you a room and suitemates. When applying with friends, a group of up to four students can rent an entire suite.
The Met is the perfect place for Cal students who want to have a private room for studying but are also seeking a chance to meet new people.
