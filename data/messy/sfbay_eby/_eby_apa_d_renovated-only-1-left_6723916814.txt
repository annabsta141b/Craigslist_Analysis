How would you like to come home from a stressful day at work and enjoy a drink or a cup of coffee overlooking serene, park-like grounds with creeks and water fountains?  Or to get that spirit-lifting boost from a great workout or swim?  And how would you like to save money at the same time?  Sound impossible? 
Simply put, we offer some of the best Studio, 1 & 2 BR apartment homes around at prices too good to pass up.  We're already $100 a month less than our competition, and we pay your water, sewer & trash which saves you an additional $55 to $85 a month or more!  Our spacious, light-filled units have wonderful amenities and well-designed floorplans.  All units have carpet, mini-blinds, central heat/air, dishwasher, outside storage plus built-in oven, range and microwave.  
We're conveniently across the street from a shopping center, and BART access is practically on our front steps.  Located near the 4 and just minutes from the 680, we are close to everything you want to do in the Bay Area.  Commute to the city during the week and tour Napa on the weekends, or go for a sail in the Sacramento River.
