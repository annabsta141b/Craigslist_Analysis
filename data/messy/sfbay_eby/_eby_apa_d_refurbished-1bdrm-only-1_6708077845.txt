    Right off of the beautiful revitalized Lake Merritt, these charming one-bedroom units are part of a new generation of "green" apartment living. This newly renovated building has solar-powered water heating and a rain powered irrigation system for its' delightful and immaculate landscaping. Walking distance from the lake, BART and dining/shopping areas, the quiet lush courtyard of the apartments is a pleasant garden respite. The sizeable one bedroom apartments boast brand new modern cabinetry, lighting, and appliances. The bathrooms are charmingly tiled, and the walls throughout are newly painted. The substantial size of the bedroom and common room, as well as the sparkling newness of all the fixtures makes these one-bedrooms a great bargain.
