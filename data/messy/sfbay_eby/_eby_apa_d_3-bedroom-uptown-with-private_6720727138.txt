As written in the New York Times, Uptown, just north of downtown Oakland, has seen a revival in the last few years. Today, it bustles with hip bars, places to hear music and interesting restaurants that have even lured San Franciscans across the bay. Old residential and commercial buildings have been restored and several new buildings developed, creating a wonderful and vibrant urban living environment in the Uptown and Oakland in general. With BART right in the neighborhood residents are more connected to downtown SF than many
This apartment comes with a private yard and is pet friendly.
