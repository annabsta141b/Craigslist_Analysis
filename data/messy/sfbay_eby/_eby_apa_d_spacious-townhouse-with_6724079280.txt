	In the world of apartments, there's a reason why the townhouse is king. Your two bedrooms are on the top floor, and your dining and entertaining areas are on your ground floor. You'll get a private two car garage for your cars and storage. You have three outdoor areas connected with your townhouse - a balcony off of the master bedroom, patio connected to your living room, and a private courtyard between your home and your garage. Doesn't this sound amazing? You're only a call away.
	Wood Creek Apartment Homes is located on 29 peaceful, serene and wonderfully landscaped acres in Pleasant Hill. Close to shopping, dining, entertainment and the Interstate 680. Sun Valley Mall, and grocery stores are within comfortable walking distance. Pets are accepted but certain breed restrictions apply. Please contact the office for details.
