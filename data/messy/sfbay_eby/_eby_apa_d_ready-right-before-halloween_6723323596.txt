 Everything you need is within reach when you live at Connolly Station. 
 With the West Dublin BART station located a few strides away from your front door and easy access to the 580 & 680 freeeway ramps, you will truly be able to explore more than the Dublin borders. Connolly Station is surrounded by Stoneridge Mall, Safeway, Target, DSW, CVS, Michael's, and so many other shopping plazas filled with boutiques and restaurants. 
 Experience convenience at its finest when you choose your new artfully-crafted apartment home at Connolly Station. With a variety of spacious floor plans and functional amenities, you are sure to want for nothing. Be amazed that the stainless steel kitchen appliances, full-size stackable washer and dryer, expansive walk-in closets, designer light fixtures, and so much more are all within your budget! 
 From this courtyard-level home, you will be steps away from all of our community amenities. You can work up a sweat in our 24-hour Fitness Center, host events in the Resident Clubhouse, grill a nice steak at the outdoor BBQ, and cool down with a dip in our resort-style pool & spa. Every home has an assigned parking space in our underground garage -- we also have Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and bike storage! If you're planning to bring along a furry friend, we are also pet-friendly (breed restrictions apply).
