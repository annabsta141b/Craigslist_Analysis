Hello, all! We're looking for a new addition to our house in Albany, for December 12th. (Earlier move-in is negotiable) 
The room available is $860/month + $860 safety deposit, utilities not included. This is a comfortable and private room with wall-to-floor wood paneling and indirect sunlight. The room is unfurnished, except for the closet that's shown in the pictures above. (The photos don't do the room justice, especially since they were taken at night). 
This 4 bedroom/2 bath house has a washer and dryer, full kitchen, living room, backyard, garage for storage, driveway, and plenty of on-street parking (no street cleaning or permits needed!) The neighborhood of Albany is incredibly charming and I personally, can't get enough of it. The house is surrounded by many shops, restaurants, bars/breweries, plant nurseries, and grocery stores. Bus lines 12, 18, 72, and 52 are nearby and the Bart is a 20-minute walk or fast bike ride away. 
We are three ladies in our mid-20's-early 30's with one small dog and one bread loving cat! Our jobs include library assistant, barista, theatre usher, and food-based start-up associate. We're genuine and easy going folks who enjoy each others company when our busy schedules allow it. For the most part, though, we tend to do our own thing.  
We're looking for someone who is communicative, respectful of space, responsible, clean, and has a stable income. No more pets please! Take some time to tell us about yourself and what you're looking for in a home! Please include your name, age, Facebook, LinkedIn, and/or Instagram handle. 
Let me know if you have any questions, or want more photos or information. Thanks!
