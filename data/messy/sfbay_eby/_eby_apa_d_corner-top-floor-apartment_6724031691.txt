Neighborhood Description:
Our beautiful north Berkeley location is surrounded by stunning architecture and sits across the street from UC Berkeley Engineering and Computer Science buildings (Jacobs, Etcheverry Halls, etc.) Around the corner is a grocery, numerous cafes and restaurants providing a variety of cuisine types. Numerous cafes in the area to grab a cup of coffee, meet friends, buy house supplies etc.
The excitement of Downtown Berkeley and the famed "Gourmet Ghetto" is a short distance away. Public transportation is around the corner and both Berkeley and Northside Berkeley BART stations are nearby. There is a beautiful park and rose garden just up the street. 
Personal favorites are: Cheeseboard Pizza, Bongo Burger, Cafe Gregoire the Thursday farmers market, monkery market and so much more! Coordonices park is lovely and other secret parks in the North Berkeley hills...
