SINGLE SUBLEASE FOR SPRING: 
Contract Time: January 1st-July 1st  
3 Bedrooms / 1 Bathroom Apartment 
I have a sublease for the spring for a single bedroom for $1370/month. I am graduating in December so I need to find a replacement for the second half of the year. This room can be a double for 685 each or a single for $1370 but that is up to you. Apartment is down on telegraph about 15 minuet walk to campus and the 6 comes every 10 minuets drops you off right in front of campus. The 6 stop is 1 block away from the apartment which is really convenient! 
The bedroom is VERY large and can easily accommodate a queen bed, a couch, desk, and drawers. This room use to be a double but is also good for a spacious single. I have pictures of it when it was a single and a double to give you an idea of how large the room is. Here are a couple of other features:
-laundry on site 
-3 bedrooms all currently singles 
-parking street parking permit
-walking distance from CVS, Walgreens, Berkeley Bowl, and Whole Foods
-We have our own entrance with a porch and our own trash bins.
