I am moving out of Novato soon, and so I am looking for someone to take over my lease, starting October 21, 2018. There is a possibility of extending the lease beyond February 11, 2019, which is when my lease ends. 
The apartment is 800 sq. ft., 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom second floor (unfurnished) end unit with great views, plenty of closet space, about 1 mile from the Safeway, 1 mile from Vintage Oaks Shopping Center, and has easy access to Highway 101. It was renovated in February 2018, just before I moved in. The monthly rent is $1800, and security deposit is $1800. Rent includes one covered parking spot, water and garbage disposal. The tenant pays for PG&E, internet and cable. Pets are allowed with an additional security deposit and monthly rent. There is a laundry room with coin-operated washer and dryer downstairs from the apartment, which is shared by four other families in the building.
