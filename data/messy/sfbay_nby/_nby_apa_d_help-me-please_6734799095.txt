Drove from New York to California to pursue acting; money ran out, lossed my job and I'm homeless... Nevertheless.. Can you get me a Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts or Subway egift card so I can use their app for bagel, coffee or subway sandwich? Living in my SUV and just need food to get by. Amazon Locker me food and hygienic products...I also have Venmo and Cash App.I can also meet you at a gas station for some gas or a box or food; you can also purchase food at a restaurant and I'll pick up at a location...If you have something in your apartment you want to get rid off and think I can sell it on Craigslist? I'll take that as well...I've provided many options and I'm grateful for any option.
Thank you kindly, and I trust that the universe will grant my wish...
