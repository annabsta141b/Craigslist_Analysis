Two room, 660 square foot one bedroom space with new kitchen, nice floors, appliances and newly tiled shower/bathroom.  Separate entrance from lightly occupied main house.  Quiet mellow individual sought for this special space with a short walk along a lovely trail to the beach. Please note that there are stairs down to the unit.  I am sorry but because of the small size and septic system constraints, this space is suitable for one person only.
$1,890/mo. or best offer. Tenant responsible for gas and electric.
If interested, kindly describe yourself and your availability.  Credit check and references required.
