Up for Grabs is my Warehouse Apt. it is a very Unique Setting .. I will try and Explain and show you what it looks like by my Pics ... if you are serious you will need to come take a peek.
It is in the Rear of my Property, and is part of my Big Building that is my Storage , we recently took the far left side of the building and turned it into a Apt. Many years ago was a Commercial Kitchen.
The Apt. is Furnished at the Moment, but we could take out anything you didn't want 
Includes all Utilities including it's Own Private Network/Wifi .
Tile Floor throughout, not many windows though, again is a unique setting 
I think is around 800 square feet but could be wrong ... it's been awhile since I measured it and can't remember
The Entrance is in the one photo between the Orange cones all the way in the back.... and side yard entrance there is a pic of as well from inside gate .
There IS a Loft above Apt. but thats Not Included and is shut off , the staircase folds up .
It is my Private storage once in a great while I need to get up there to get something.
