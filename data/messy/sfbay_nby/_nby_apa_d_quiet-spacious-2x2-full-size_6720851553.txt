 Property Description 
At Capri Creek Apartments, our beautiful community offers a variety of amenities that make apartment living fun! On the weekends our residents can relax in the comfort of their apartment homes, or take advantage of the many community features that we provide. In warm weather, lawn bowling on the practice green is a favorite activity of many residents. Other residents prefer to lounge by the pool or sit in the spa to relieve achy muscles and tension. If residents have a reason to celebrate, they are welcome to host an event in our elegant clubhouse or use the outdoor barbecue and picnic area to entertain guests. Join our community today in a well-appointed two-bedroom apartment to start living your weekends to the fullest. If you tire of the features on our lush landscaped grounds, Lagunitas Brewery is only six minutes away and promises good times with live music and handcrafted beer. Visit us today to see why you belong at Capri Creek!
