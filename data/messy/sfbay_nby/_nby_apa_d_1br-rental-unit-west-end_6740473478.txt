I have a 1-bedroom unit for rent on the west end of Sebastopol, about 15 minutes from town, near Freestone . It is on the ground floor of the main house where I live, and it is 740 square feet with lots of windows. The unit is on 2 acres of rural property, with  raised beds for growing food, a man made pond, a cob oven, and a large meadow bordered by a deep redwood forest with trails running through it.  The unit features a wood stove along with forced air heating from a new propane furnace, a new dishwasher, a refrigerator, an electric range, and a shower with two outdoor bath tubs.
This rental would work especially well for a young couple that enjoys gardening or has some permaculture experience. No pets and no smokers. Washer/dryer is available for use on the property, and there is ample off street parking. 
Rent is $1600 per month on a 1-year lease, and $100 per month for utilities (gas, electric, Wi-Fi, trash - water comes from a well with a new pump, and the plumbing is on a septic system), with a security deposit of $2400 (1.5 months rent). Available now, but it is important for me to find the right people to be on this extraordinary land.
