Hello There! I have a space that has just opened up in West Petaluma in a renovated granny unit overlooking town. A major plus is how accessible it is to downtown Petaluma via Old Redwood Highway. Yet the home is still very private and peaceful on a serene green acre. 
There is much more room for activities. The kitchen is lovely and brand new! 
- $1599: for this in-law studio overlooking Petaluma with ample space all around here on the acre. (Includes utilities) 
You:
Looking for someone professional, responsible, clean, personable, funny, and respectful of others while willing to create a friendly and comfortable environment among neighbors
The home is close to downtown Petaluma, (5 min) a hardware store, the outlets, a convenience store, and Vet right just down the road. It is very convenient! I look forward to hearing from you!
