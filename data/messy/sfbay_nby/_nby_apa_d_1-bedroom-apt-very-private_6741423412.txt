This apartment is unique and rarely on the market.  Not part of an apartment complex, but part of a private residence, it is a lovely fully furnished one-bedroom with its own private deck and entry, and surrounded by coastal oak trees.  It is designer-furnished, with a large living/dining room, pullman-style kitchen, and spacious bedroom.  Due to the two grand rooms, this apartment "lives large." The living room/dining room has a large Bay window with a beautiful water view.  The bedroom gets plenty of light and a super-comfortable bed.  There is off-street parking in nearby parking lot, practically unheard of in Sausalito.  There is ample storage space.  Very easy commute to San Francisco by car, bus or ferry.  Very quiet and private.  Available soon after credit approval. Call or email for viewing.
