 Property Description  Crossbrook Apartments is currently offering a two-bedroom, one-and-a-quarter-bathroom renovated apartment in a fantastic location. Our property is perfectly situated between Highway 101 and Sonoma State University. Those who drive frequently love the convenience of the nearby roadways, as they provide quick access to Santa Rosa and the entire Bay Area. The community is also near a variety of public transportation options if you would rather skip the hassle of parking. When you're on your way home, stop by one of the grocery stores to get what you need to prepare a meal. There are also restaurants for when you don't feel like using your fully outfitted kitchen. You'll be able to pull up into your up-front parking spot when you get home. Change into your active wear and head to the fitness center, or take your dog for a walk along the nearby trails. When you lead a busy life, there are few things better than coming home to a beautiful apartment at the end of the day.
