On one of the sweetest tree lined streets in Corte Madera, with cul-de-sac and at the foot of Christmas Tree Hill, a supreme commute location in Corte Madera, this beautifully updated studio apartment is located in a Victorian Estate. Privately situated with its own brick patio,  and lovingly  renovated with many hi end details, including brushed nickel fixtures, new appliances, fresh paint and attractive tile throughout.  Tenants enjoy the property's old world charm and ambiance from the shared patio near a small redwood grove, situated to maximize the views and serenity. The estate even has its own deer families that frequent the gardens. There is easy street parking, a private locking storage area, and a convenient shared laundry room. Kitties ok. No smoking.
