 Property Description  Residents living at Crossbrook Apartments have many amenities to enjoy. Free time can be spent splashing in the resort pool. The refreshing waters feel great when it's hot out. After a splash, lie back on the patio furniture and let the sun dry you off. The pool is surrounded by an expansive sun deck and features a shady area. The playground is another fun place to use up a little extra energy. Especially active residents love that we have an on-site fitness center and proximity to miles of recreation trails. It is convenient to be able to work out right from home. Residents with pets often go jogging along the trails then come back and sit in the outdoor spa for a while. In addition to the fun amenities we offer plenty of conveniences. There is covered parking for almost every car and a nightly courtesy patrol watch. Our community features a laundry facility that is clean and modern. Come by and we can show you around the property!
