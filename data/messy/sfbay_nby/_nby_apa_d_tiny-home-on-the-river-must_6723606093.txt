Are you looking for a tiny home experience? Then this may be the place for you! This studio would be ideal for one person, but could accommodate two people who are minimalists. This studio has a big open layout with lots of room for creativity and there is a loft for storage. Pets are welcome with an extra deposit, however there is no fenced yard.There are chickens (and crowing roosters), dogs, and a cat on the property. It's a ten minute walk to mom's beach, and a 18 mile drive to downtown Santa Rosa feel like your out in nature but still close to town. 
This cozy studio has all of the amenities needed; a spacious bathroom, full kitchen, shared laundry on site, and safe parking in driveway. 
Please tell me a little about yourself when inquiring and why this would be a good place for you.
All utilities are included as well as wifi, there is no cable. There is a $1000 deposit upon move in, and additional deposit for pets.
