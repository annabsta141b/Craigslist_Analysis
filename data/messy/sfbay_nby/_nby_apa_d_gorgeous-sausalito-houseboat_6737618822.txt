"Whim" Houseboat Description: 
Whim is an open studio layout, with 3 patio areas, windows on all sides and hardwood floors.  We lofted the Queen size bed to provide a more roomy sleeping space with beautiful views out to the Sausalito hillside. Beneath the lofted bed we crafted a built in desk space/lounge area. The bathroom features black penny rounds on the floor and subway tiles on the walls with a shower and Marine toilet. We added a vanity area with a beautiful brass mirror. 
Our kitchen feels homey, with a full size porcelain sink, butcher block counters and a 2 burner electric range. A cute dining table is nestled in the corner. There are thoughtful and chic decorations throughout, like handmade driftwood shelves, cheerful succulents, brass chandelier and airy white curtains.  You can choose to keep any furnishing aboard, or we are happy to remove them.
The Dock: 
We are docked in the heart of Sausalito, across the street from the Lighthouse Cafe and next to Bar Bocce. We are in what the locals call the "Banana Belt" since the fog tends to be blocked by the mountain ridge we face--so it's typically much warmer here!   
Rent Includes all electrical and water!
Ideal for one person as closet space is limited.  Cats and dogs welcome with a deposit :)
Deposit is one month's rent.  It is a 6 month lease followed by month to month (30 days notice for move out). Viewings by appointment.  Ideal move in is Nov 10th, though we can be flexible for an earlier move.
