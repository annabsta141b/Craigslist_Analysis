CURRENT APPLICATION PROCESS 
Only upon the receipt of an application (with required documentation and Photo I.D.) can we temporarily place a hold on a specific apartment for you, and fully process your application, which will then either be approved or denied. 
If approved, you then have the option to follow up by providing us with a $500.00 holding deposit (in the form of a Cashier's Check or Money Order made payable to: El Prado Apartments, LP,) and signing our holding deposit agreement. Upon notifying you of being approved, we generally give you until the end of the following business day to submit the holding deposit, and sign the holding deposit agreement. If we do not have a holding deposit agreement in place beyond that time, we discontinue the temporary hold on the apartment, and it is available to other applicants. 
Nothing short of the above process holds an apartment for you or reserves a place in line for one. 
We are not accepting Housing Vouchers at this time.
Thank you for considering El Prado Apartments, LP!
