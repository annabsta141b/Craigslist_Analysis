Looking for a sweet little place to live? Look no further. This 1 bedroom, 1 bath unit is on a cul de sac of fruit trees that put on a show of magnificent colors in the spring. You will have your own private entrance with a patio graced with a beautiful little garden. This is a pristine, cozy place... that is clean, neat and just darn cute. One of the greatest features is the light quality in the living room and kitchen. 
This place is perfect for busy professionals who seeks a private refuge. Our tenants like a quiet lifestyle. You will have what feels like a cottage in a four-plex (with a laundry room).  Plus carport parking for one car. Close to shopping and five minutes from the Plaza.
We offer you a non-smoking environment with good neighbors. No pets. We will only consider those with excellent credit. 
Rent is $1575.00 plus utilities. A one-year lease. Deposit is one and half times the monthly rent. 
Available now.  If you are interested in this place, send us a note to tell us about yourself and those living with you and about your credit.  Thanks
