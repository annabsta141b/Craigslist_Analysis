 Property Description 
A two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment home is currently available to new residents at Capri Creek Apartments in a quiet neighborhood in north Petaluma. The spacious floor plan of this apartment makes everyday living a breeze. Even residents who don’t like cooking can appreciate the ease of using a fully equipped kitchen with all-white appliances, which include a refrigerator, dishwasher, and stove. The kitchen is open to a spacious living room that is cable ready, making it easy for residents to catch up on their latest shows. The home boasts two patios or balconies, a large one off the living room and a smaller, private one off a bedroom that would make a great nook for morning coffee or reading. Just steps from our apartments, residents can find hours of entertainment on a fun playground, dive into a refreshing pool, or host an event in the elegant clubhouse. For more convenience, our community is located a short walk from G & G Supermarket and around the corner from Santa Rosa Junior College.
