Dear Humans,
It has been brought to my attention that there is a community in the beautiful Bennett Valley area of Santa Rosa that loves pets. As your loyal, loving companion, I feel it is my duty to make sure you are aware of Sonoma Ridge at Bennett Valley Apartments. This is where I want our new home to be. 
Sonoma Ridge at Bennett Valley has beautifully renovated apartments with stainless steel appliances, plank floors, plush carpeting, and complimentary covered parking! (The only problem with this place is that they allow cats, too). At Sonoma Ridge at Bennett Valley, they have lush landscaping, a heated pool with resort style seating, a bocce ball court, and A DOG PARK JUST FOR ME!!!
If you move to Sonoma Ridge at Bennett Valley, I promise to stop eating your slippers...maybe.
Love,
The Dog
P.S. Feed me a biscuit. They have a cookie jar in the leasing office just for ME...and I hear there is a coffee bar for the humans.
