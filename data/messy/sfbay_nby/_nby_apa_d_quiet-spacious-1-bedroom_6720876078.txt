Hi there!
I've loved living in my Napa cottage at Vineyard Terrace but I'm relocating to the Peninsula for work. I'm flexible with respect to your move-in date. However, if you move in any time before November 10, 2018, I will pay your deposit. The market rate for this unit is approximately $2000/mo. but the rate changes daily so you would need to check with the leasing office and I can work with you to move in on a day that works best for your budget.
My unit is surrounded by lush trees so it stays cool in the summer and you can save on the cost of A/C! I've not had any problems with the dishwasher, the in unit washer/dryer, or any other appliances. There is a trash valet which is super convenient. The neighbors are quiet, friendly, and personable. The neighborhood is safe, pet-friendly, and there is a scenic trail right behind the unit that runs adjacent to the Napa river. You'll also have access to a clean, communal pool and a small gym. 
Please email or text to schedule an appointment to see the cottage. You'll love it! Cheers!
