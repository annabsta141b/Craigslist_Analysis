The apartment is currently occupied until November 30. There may be a little painting or touch up needed so it potentially can be occupied somewhere between Dec 1-5. The currant tenant was very clean so there is a good chance very little needs to be done.   
Arrangements can be made for viewing with a little advance notice. The photos were taken just before the last tenants occupied it 14 months ago.
