CURRENT APPLICATION PROCESS 
APARTMENT AVAILABILITY: 
We begin marketing specific apartments once there has been legal notification that a tenant is moving out. Some Tenants, after having given legal notice that they are vacating, extend their move out date. Occasionally, tenants leave suddenly without warning. Additionally, some applicants are not approved, and others that are approved, do not follow through. This means that the normal availability of specific apartments is a rather sporadic variable... So...?
We work diligently to give what solid ground to applicants there is.
TO HELP ACCOMPLISH THIS: 
We strongly encourage you to physically apply as soon as possible, and to without delay provide us with any of the required documentation not supplied to us at the time we received your application. 
Only upon the receipt of an application (with required documentation and Photo I.D.) can we temporarily place a hold on a specific apartment for you, and fully process your application, which will then either be approved or denied. 
If approved, you then have the option to follow up by providing us with a $500.00 holding deposit (in the form of a Cashier's Check or Money Order made payable to: El Prado Apartments, LP,) and signing our holding deposit agreement. Upon notifying you of being approved, we generally give you until the end of the following business day to submit the holding deposit, and sign the holding deposit agreement. If we do not have a holding deposit agreement in place beyond that time, we discontinue the temporary hold on the apartment, and it is available to other applicants. 
Nothing short of the above process holds an apartment for you or reserves a place in line for one. 
We are not accepting Housing Vouchers at this time.
Thank you for considering El Prado Apartments, LP!
