Sorry to anyone who inquired earlier, it ended up we were not ready yet. Now it's a "go", and we are all ready. 
Our 1 bedroom duplex is located in a safe family neighborhood near Fuller Park. You will enjoy beautiful original oak hardwood floors, a large living room with lots of light, and cute kitchen with gas range.  The duplex has a nice finished garage with washer/dryer hookups (there is a washer and dryer there, that you are welcome to use).  A small back patio area perfect for a barbecue and small table and chairs.  Perfect for 1 or 2 quiet, responsible people. We do not allow pets of any kind, so please do not ask us if we will make an exception. No smoking anywhere on the property.  Application for all tenants must be filled out before showing. Background check and credit check.  Please do not ask if the duplex is still available, we will take the ad down as soon as it is rented. Phone calls only please.
