 Property Description  With two huge bedrooms and two full size bathrooms to match, the Chateau model from River Oaks is definitely the best bet! You'll enjoy a cozy fireplace during the chilly months and a private outdoor patio for California summer evenings. Choose the Chateau and you'll also be able to take care of laundry from the comfort of your own home plus you'll finally have the kitchen of your dreams. Satisfy the "Iron Chef" in you by preparing delicious meals atop the bountiful counters. After dinner let the dishwasher handle cleanup while you relax on the couch. Each bedroom features its own full bath, crown molding, and a huge, walk-in closet that's guaranteed to hold every outfit. At River Oaks we've got the home you need plus a ton of fun community amenities to enjoy including ball courts, a year-round pool, fitness center, and an e-lounge with internet.
