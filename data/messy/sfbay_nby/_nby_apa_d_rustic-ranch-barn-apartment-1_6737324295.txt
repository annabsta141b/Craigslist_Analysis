$1,550/month.  One bedroom +, one bathroom rustic barn apartment on ranch property.  We are looking for one person who has good credit and solid references on a month-to-month lease. 
This "barn apartment" is part of a barn!  Partially furnished (no bed).  Apartment is located 5 miles out of Petaluma on gated owner-occupied working ranch in West Petaluma.  We have wildlife: squirrels, turkeys, deer and bats, jack rabbits to red-tailed hawks, and yes, even an occasional mouse.  This is country living!  
Owner's reserve right to have horses around the barn, use of tack room, and covered porch for ranch vehicle parking. 
New carpeting in bedroom, knotty pine walls in modest living/kitchen/bathrooms - all very clean.  No washer or dryer - you'll need to use a local laundromat. Single car parking, no other vehicles.  PG&E separately metered and in addition to rent, garbage included.
