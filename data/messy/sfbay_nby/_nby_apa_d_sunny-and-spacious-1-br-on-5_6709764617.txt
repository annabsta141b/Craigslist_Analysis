	*	Huge sunken living room -  french doors from kitchen (then 3 steps) that have been soundproofed, french doors leading out to deck with stunning views, wood stove, ceiling fan, south facing wall of windows gets plenty of sun.

	*	1 bath - stall shower, no tub
	*	Laundry room with front loading washer/dryer is shared with the main house.
4.7 acres of land with beautiful views has amazing birdwatching & weather watching and features woods with a creek, sunny yards, orchards (35 apple trees), many gardens (wildflower, herb, many huge veggie gardens, butterfly), chicken coop, goat pen, and more. You're encouraged to share all that, but there's also a couple of garden spaces and yard on your side of the house, too, for your own personal gardening. Can trade regular farm chores for produce and eggs.  Nature trails.
Rent is $1800/month.  Utilities are not separately metered from the house, so we charge a flat rate of $100/month for all utilities (electric, gas, water treatment, trash removal, and high speed wireless internet).  Total per month, including rent and all utilities is $1900.
Please note that we host a pre-school and home-school enrichment program on the property, open to children during the school year 9am-2pm 4 days a week.  The school is all outside unless pouring rain and is located on the other side of the house from this unit, so it is quite separate from the space being rented, and has minimal impact on the unit. 
We are looking for a maximum of 2 people who:
	*	Embrace nature education and love children
	*	Are excited about living on a farm and occasional care of chickens and watering when we're not here
	*	Practice "green" living:  heat low in winter, not generate much trash, composting, hang clothes sometimes, etc.
	*	Can pass background check including fingerprinting 
Please respond with details of your situation, such as your employment history, and what your housing needs are.  The more you can tell me about yourself and your other applicants is much appreciated.  Sorry, but we cannot have cats or dogs -- we already have 2 cats who think they own the place, and would not get along well with others.
Thanks for looking.
