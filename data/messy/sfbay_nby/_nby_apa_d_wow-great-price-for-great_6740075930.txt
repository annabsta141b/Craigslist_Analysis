One of the best parts about living in this one-bedroom, one-bathroom home from Addison Ranch is that you get to share it with your cat and/or dog. We welcome pets of all sizes. Canines love that the nearby Lucchesi Park has a dog area! You and your furry companion are sure to feel right at home with the open layout of this newly remodeled apartment. The cabinets are new and now feature beautiful, brushed nickel hardware. Not only does the kitchen have new cabinets but it also features stainless steel appliances that include a range, a refrigerator, and a built-in microwave. The dishwasher is great for quick cleaning. This home is comfortable no matter the season thanks to the central heat and air conditioning.
