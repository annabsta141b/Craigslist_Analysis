I would like to team up with another single mom or a family in order to rent a house/apartment and create some supportive community around meal prep etc. I work and can afford up to 1200 in rent. I strive for a healthy whole foods diet. I am substance free. A big lover of the outdoors, music, dancing, reading, museums. Looking forward to hearing from you!
