I have a studio apartment available in Lakeport with views of the Lake.  This apartment is a furnished vacation rental unit and comes with two full beds, a full kitchen, and a full bathroom.  All utilities are included too.  You will have the following utilities paid for you:  electricity, gas, sewer, water, garbage, cable TV, and internet.  All you need to do is move right in.  This is a perfect location at the lake and is very close to the hospital, medical center and medical offices, local schools, County of Lake government offices, and downtown Lakeport.  A short drive to area wineries.  Rent weekly at $320/ week or monthly at $1180/ month.
