Terrific small 1bedroom1 bath apartment in a recently remodeled c.1898 Victorian.  This southern facing apartment is in the sunny banana belt area of Sausalito.  It features wood and tile floors throughout the living area, and carpet in the bedroom for those chilly Sausalito mornings.  The living room features a gas-burning fireplace with a Killer southern sunny view of San Francisco and the bay.  The small bedroom is also southern facing and enjoys an equally dramatic Killer view of San Francisco along with tons of sun.  This top floor apartment has a big tub in the bathroom, and also a large storage/closet room. 
This apartment is a very easy commute and is just minutes away from San Francisco.  If you prefer to take the commuter bus or the Ferry service, there is an old stairway that leads directly to downtown Sausalito, the bus stop, as well as the Ferry terminal.  If you like, you can stop in at one of the local coffee shops for a quick cup of coffee before work or a latte on the weekends.  
I am offering this unique, quiet, sunny, bright and cheerful apartment for $2,750 per month with a one-year lease.  Water and refuse are included and coin-operated washer and dryer are available on site. This apartment will be available October 15th.  No smoking, no dogs but cats are OK.  Contact Bob only by phone between the hours of 9:30 am and 6 pm.  show contact info
