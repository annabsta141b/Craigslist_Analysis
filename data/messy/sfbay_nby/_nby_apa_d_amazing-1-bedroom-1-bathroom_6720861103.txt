DESCRIPTION
If you want a place to call home and not just an apartment, you are at the right place. Albion Terrace Apartment Homes are designed to feel more like a home than an apartment. Enjoy plenty of old world charm with modern sensibilities. We pride ourselves on our renovated interiors and lush well-groomed exteriors. We are situated uniquely in the hub of the Bay Area, one of the most sought after locations in the U.S. Not only are we just 20 miles north of San Francisco, and 15 miles west of the East Bay, we are also conveniently located next to the Northgate Mall, Kaiser Hospital, public transportation, schools, and Hwy 101. Yet at the same time, Albion Terrace Apartments offers a quiet setting with park like garden surroundings. If you are a commuter, or just a Bay Area enthusiast, this is a dream come true!
