 Property Description  One of our best assets is our location! Crossbrook Apartments is in the heart of Rohnert Park. We are just a mile from Sonoma State University and only a block from the intersection of Highway 101 and Rohnert Park Expressway. Travelling into the Bay Area or to Santa Rosa is quick and easy. There are many community amenities waiting for you after a busy day in the Bay. We have a fully equipped fitness center right on our grounds. Say goodbye to that expensive gym membership, and driving across town just to work out will be a thing of the past. Residents that enjoy outdoor activity often take advantage of the Copeland Creek Bike/Walk Trail. Kick back on the couch after jogging with your pet. Relax in the air conditioning or head to the balcony or patio for a beverage. Each of the two bedrooms has a massive closet and access to a private bathroom for unmatched comfort.
