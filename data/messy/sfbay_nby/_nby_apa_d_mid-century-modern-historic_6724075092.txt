Belvedere, artistic, dual structure, multi-level, hillside estate home on over an acre of land. Fabulous home consists of two triangular structures connected by a skyway. The property faces Richardson Bay and Sausalito with sweeping views from Mt Tamalpais to the Golden Gate. One half of the home has the common areas, the other has the residential accommodations; both face the view to the west. Floors are hardwood, carpeted and tiled. Home is very bright with many ceiling-to-floor windows and sliding glass doors. Living room and bedrooms have uninterrupted, building-width balconies.
The heart of the home is the nearly full floor living room. The two bay-facing sides have ceiling-to-floor windows and a full width balcony running along both sides. Living room has a wood beam cathedral ceiling, central skylight and stand-alone fireplace. The third side of the structure has the main entrance, an office space, shelving, closets and a half bath. Kitchen is in the garden facing corner and has partial height walls. It includes kitchen island, gas range, oven, dishwasher, preparation area, and laundry room with stacked washer/dryer and opens directly onto the deck of the upper garden.
A skyway bridge connects the two triangular sections of the home. The top floor of the second half of the home is the master suite. It has its own wrap around balcony with a bay view, a large bedroom open on one side to a study with wood stove, full-wall shelving and an office at the far side. The master bath's first room has sink and cabinets, the second room has a soaking tub and glass shower stall.
The second and third bedrooms are on the floor below. Both bedrooms have private baths and access to a wrap around balcony with the same view as the master suite above. One bedroom has a walk-through closet that connects it to the bath. Bath has an extra long tub, glass shower stall, and sink with extensive counter. The other bedroom has a three-area bath with sink in one corner, steam sauna shower stall in another and toilet in the third.
The floor below the second floor has a guest suite with private access from the far side of the house. It has a living area, open bedroom and kitchenette, and bath with shower stall. Kitchenette has a stove top, sink, and half fridge.
Below the first half of the home, accessed from the lower level outdoors, are a laundry room on the living room side, an au pair arrangement with bath with shower stall, and a two-level work space with storage. Each half of the home has a separate storage room as well.
The garden, designed by Lawrence Halprin, is extensive and ideal for entertaining. The parking area connects to the main lawn, raised level barbecue area, enclosed vegetable garden, stacked wood along one of many paths, and dining terrace with sectioned tree trunk inset base. The property has wooded and semi-open spaces with pathways and stairs leading to a secluded seating area and views of the Golden Gate. In addition, there is a two-level lower garden with lily pond and small cabin with bunk beds.
Tenant pays a one-time broker's fee.
