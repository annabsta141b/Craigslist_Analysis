The room will not be available until January 1st. I am a late 20's professional that works 6 days a week. Looking for someone in their 20's-30's. $850 all utilities included. Private bedroom is a good size and has a walk-in closet. We would share a bathroom and have a half-bath downstairs. Washer and Dryer inside the house. Close to SSU.
