You can enjoy a relaxing atmosphere in a garden style setting....convenient to everything, yet set back just enough to get a little bit of that country feel.
We're only minutes from the 101 freeway and Hwy 12....Kaiser Permanente is also nearby, close to numerous business complexes...some of the finest shopping in Northern California, performing arts centers, many reknown restaurants, and award winning local wineries that are set alongside our country roads for you to enjoy. We are convenient to just about every college north of the Golden Gate Bridge...SSU, Empire College, SRJC, and many other vocational schools nearby. We're only a short drive to the ocean, San Francisco, and so many other wonderful places yet for you to explore and discover.
