This is a one bedroom, full bath, 4 closets, very spacious feeling because of decks and lay out.
Neighbors almost all have dogs. It is a very fun community. Hiking trails right outside the door. Dog park 5 blocks away.
This is a perfect opportunity for someone to enjoy their cigs, pot, drinking and you must love cars! The owner has turned the carport into an auto repair shop which is right below the back deck. 
I think this place is one of a kind and has many great qualities. But it is not conducive to my lifestyle.
The rent is $1995. Deposit $2000. It was just painted and carpets cleaned. Super sweet one bedroom. 
I can be flexible on move in date. But first one to rent will def be obliged. 
Just email with a phone number so we can talk. (I find it is easier than texting and emailing.) Then we can set up a time for you to see the place, meet your neighbors and fill out an application.
You can take over my lease till April 15th, 2019 or the owner will sign you for a year and you can secure the rental rate. 
Please only inquire if you actually want to rent a place, can afford $2000 and are willing to fill out an app. No application fee, no credit check.
