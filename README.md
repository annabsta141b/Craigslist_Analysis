# Craigslist_Analysis


Craigslist is a website that allows people to post classified advertisement for free. These posts can span a variety of subjects such as cars, bikes, jobs, and even housing. 

### Apartment Rental
Use exploratory data analysis to  analyse any trends and patterns in the data and discuss any abnormalities in the data.  


### Messy Data
The goal of  is to clean and extract features from a messy, expanded version of the Craiglists dataset where each apartment posting is in a seperate text file. Then I will focus on creating and analysing a clean dataset of  apartment rental postings in California using exploratory data analysis along with various visualizations to  analyse any trends and patterns.
